					<description><![CDATA[I have a 1.8 GHz Mini and it have had problems with all 1080p before I found osxbmc.
I think it is kinda silly that a 1.8 GHz dual core machine can&#039;t play 1080p.
Well now with osxbmc I can wiew it without any problems.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[FYI, the FFmpeg devs are currently working on a better &quot;fast option&quot; for H.264 playback with FFmpeg

[FFmpeg-devel] [PATCH] make fast option with h264 actually do something:
http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2008-February/thread.html#42162

I think the reason why someone would be willing to use skiploopfilter and sacrifice picture quality is if they got say an older Mac mini connected to a 720p display but they download native 1080p videos that they like to play on that setup. The older Mac mini will not be able to playback that perfectly smooth without some serious compromise like the skiploopfilter.

Yes but by all means, please make it have an optional setting in the GUI.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Elan

Please don&#039;t sacrifice picture quality to get better framerates in OSXBMC.

For those that have a very fast Mac, we just want the best picture quality no matter what :)

Of course there should a way for slower machines (Mac Mini&#039;s ie.) to play HD content, but please consider making it an option/setting that can be turned on/off.

Thanks :)

					<description><![CDATA[@Jarkko Laiho or anyone else having the shutdown problem. Attach to the process after you&#039;ve exited (but it&#039;s still hanging).

Use this to look for the process number
$ ps axuw &#124; grep XBMC

Attach to process (substitute the process number for xxxx, of course)
$ gdb /Applications/XBMC.app/Contents/MacOS/XBMC xxxx

Get a list of threads

For each thread:

					<description><![CDATA[@ Jarkko &#038; elan

I&#039;m having the same &#039;force quit&#039; problem running on a MBP CoreDuo.

Don&#039;t know my way around console or logs very well but point me in the right direction and I&#039;ll post some for you if you&#039;d like.

@elan

Very nice work. When the new MBP is purchased, this one will definitely be replaced by a Mini. Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[inloop deblocking filter decoding in mandatory in the H.264 specification so using the skiploopfilter option in FFmpeg is probably not a good idea. It will not only cause reduced perceived visual quality but it could also generate serious color artifacts to appear.

Sure it might be fun to test it, but now you have been warned :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@elan:

Uhh... this is odd enough. If I run XBMC from the command line as you suggest, it shuts down just fine. But if I run it by double-clicking the icon in Finder, the shutdown doesn&#039;t complete.

The last two lines, when I run from the command-line, are:

CRITSEC[0x970c64]: Trying to enter destroyed section.
CritSect[0x970c64]: Some other thread trying to leave our critical section.

These never appear in the case of a GUI shutdown (I&#039;m monitoring the messages in Console).

The first three lines appear in both cases:

WARNING: The XBMC_HOME environment variable is not set.
++ WARN: could not retrieve file info for `image.nrg&#039;: No such file or directory
++ WARN: can&#039;t open nrg image file image.nrg for reading

Browsing the Console logs further, these two messages concerning XBMC appeared at some point, too:

CPSGetCurrentProcess(): This call is deprecated and should not be called anymore.
CPSSetForegroundOperationState(): This call is deprecated and should not be called anymore.

Deprecation isn&#039;t fatal, but I thought I should report them anyway.

I really don&#039;t know what could be causing this. I erased the XBMC app support files before upgrading, so this can&#039;t be due to some inter-version cruft, at least.

If you think this issue is worth investigating (or even possible to investigate, given its strange nature), just tell me and I&#039;ll file a bug in Trac.]]></description>
