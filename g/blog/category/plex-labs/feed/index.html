										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We started Plex Labs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-labs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">just over two years ago</a> to provide, among other things, a playground for new apps (both our own, as well as 3rd-party apps that struck our fancy) that build on our awesome media platform. Plex can be like a fractal—everyone has their own view of what the most important parts of the platform are, and you can zoom into any one of these and spend a lifetime working on perfecting and improving that little area. In other words, a thousand zen gardens&#8230;</p>
<h3>A Brand New Plexamp</h3>
<h4>“The only kind of writing is rewriting” – Ernest Hemingway</h4>
<p>When we first launched Plex Labs, our first release was Plexamp, a tiny, highly opinionated desktop music player. But after a year of updates, things went quiet. Had we abandoned it? Was the llama tired of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-slogan-of-Winamp-whip-the-llamas-ass-mean-for-you">being whipped</a>? Had the zen garden suddenly filled with weeds? Nope. Inspired by the promise of the first releases, and our shared love with Hemingway of a <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/hemingway-daiquiri-recipe-760527">great daiquiri</a>, we decided to <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">rewrite the whole thing from scratch</a>, add a ton of features, and then release it (today? Sure why not!) on five platforms: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
<h4>One hundred and ten is the magic number</h4>
<p>We’re calling the new version 3.0 (although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x">3.11</a> might have been more appropriate) and there are so many new features that we’ve written an entire <a href="https://medium.com/plexlabs/plexamp-v3-9af3b10063b4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medium post</a> about them. If you already use music on Plex, you’re going to love it. And if you don’t, maybe it’s time to give it a try?</p>
<p>Over the last year, our small group of fearless testers has gone through 110 (that’s <em>one-hundred-and-ten</em>) betas, and it might be easiest to let their words speak for themselves:</p>
<div style="margin: 0px -30px 20px;">

<p style="font-size: 1em; font-style: italic; margin-top: -40px !important; text-align: center; color: #868c96;">To our eyes, it doesn’t suck.</p>
<p>The new version of Plexamp is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/purchase?plan=monthly&#038;utm_source=Plex&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_content=pp_plexamp_inline&#038;utm_campaign=Plex+Labs+April+15+2020+nonPP" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass</a> only. And if you need further incentive to go ahead and grab that glorious Plex Pass, Plexamp isn’t the only app we’re launching today&#8230;</p>
<h3>Introducing Plex Dash</h3>
<h4>A dash of power</h4>
<p>As you might imagine, plenty of us here at Plex run our own personal media servers and like keeping a close eye on them. So why not a single-purpose app dedicated to server administration? Like many things in the history of Plex, the genesis of Plex Dash involved scratching some itches. First of all, we wanted a beautiful way to see all playbacks, even across multiple servers; something you might repurpose an old iPad for, duct taping it to a wall in your secret lair. Something to gaze at while you stroke your hairless cat. You know the drill.</p>
<p>Secondly, we wanted a fun way for you to help edit your artwork and make your library even lovelier during any spare moment: one-handed while wrangling the kids, or in a few minutes of downtime between video calls. And last, but not least, we wanted raw administrative power: scan for new media, fix incorrect matches, check on server resource usage, tweak library settings, even view server logs live.</p>
<p>Plex Dash is built on top of the same codebase as Plexamp – check out  this <a href="https://medium.com/plexlabs/plex-dash-c42d1f624877" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medium post</a> for more details about its many features. Plex Dash is available for all <a href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/purchase?plan=monthly&#038;utm_source=Plex&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_content=pp_plex_dash_inline&#038;utm_campaign=Plex+Labs+April+15+2020+nonPP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plex Pass</a> holders today, on iOS and Android.</p>

<h3>Apps for days</h3>
<p>So we’re super excited to share these two Plex Lab apps. Because they’re lab-born, we’ll continue to tinker with them, and you should keep in mind that they are not officially supported. But if you’re excited to check them out, head to your friendly neighborhood app store (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Plex+Labs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/plex-labs/id1500797509" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a>) or our brand new <a href="https://plexamp.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plexamp.com</a> site (for the desktop apps), take them for a spin, and let us know what you think in our <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/c/testing/plex-labs">Plex Labs forum</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at Plex, we live and breathe media. We collect it, make it beautiful, argue about it with friends, and fall asleep to it. For many of us, Plex was “nights and weekends” before it was a job—we are the tinkerers, the hackers, the builders. We’ve rallied around common goals, working towards a shared vision. We may not agree on everything, like which set of Star Wars movie posters are best, which Blade Runner cut is the best—duh, the Final one—or whether or not <a href="http://www.x3mhc.no/dokumenter/SE-v-PP-Part1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-ended tube amps</a> are worth the trouble. For us, media is somewhere between a hobby and an obsession, and honestly, much closer to the latter.</p>
<p>Plex is not a monolithic company; we have a full-time core, an extended ring of part-timers, a growing group of amazing <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/220049328#who-might-you-see" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Ninjas</a>, and then of course our beloved community at large. There have been plenty of cases where people move between these orbitals, sparked by a passion project. For example, Eric wrote an early incarnation of the web app, and now runs all of web for us; Ian wrote lots of channels in the early days and now runs the client teams; I started working on the software known as OSXBMC almost exactly ten years ago, bored and lonely while my wife was away; there are plenty more examples.</p>
<p>It’s exactly this ethos which makes us proud to launch Plex Labs, with <span style="font-weight: 400">a few initial goals:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-depth technical writing around all that is Plex:</strong> Our blog has worked to maintain a proper balance between someone who might be new to Plex, and a more technical audience. We decided that having a separate publication on Medium would be a better approach for us to “let loose” with some deeper discussions, and maybe the occasional longer post on JavaScript frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Celebrate internal passion projects: <span style="font-weight: 400">We can’t help it, media is fun! What’s an engineer to do on a rainy weekend if it’s not build something cool? And now we have a way to share these projects with you. Sure, they’re unsupported, but they might also be awesome.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>Give exposure to great community projects:</strong> There are people out there doing amazing things with Plex, and we love their creativity. It can be hard for a regular user to find these projects, which might be hidden away on a forum, and, well, we think they’re crazy cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re launching the new <a href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Labs</a> section of our website today, along with our first Plex Labs post on Medium. If you’ve got a Plex music library and long for the days when a certain music player (that really whipped the llama’s ass) had a permanent spot in the corner of your screen, this is a special day, because we’re doing a Plex Labs debut of a great little player we call <a href="https://medium.com/plexlabs/introducing-plexamp-9493a658847a" target="_blank">Plexamp</a>. If you don’t use Plex for music, you just might <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/music/" target="_blank">start</a>&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/untitled.jpg" alt="untitled.jpg" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">One year later, we have a great media center that feels at home on the Mac, a talented group of developers and designers, t-shirts, a website, a canine mascot, and most importantly, a thriving community of great people. Many, many thanks to everyone who helped along the way, I&#8217;m incredibly excited to see what the next year of Plex brings!</p>
