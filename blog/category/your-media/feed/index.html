<h3>Crackle adds thousands of more free movies and TV shows to Plex</h3>
<p>Welp, Plexians, you’ve devoured tens and tens of MILLIONS of minutes of Plex Free Movies and TV. You dined on <em>The Terminator</em>, gnawed on <em>Lord of War</em>, and satiated your sweet tooth with <em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/movie/take-me-home-tonight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take Me Home Tonight</a></em>. Every month we’ve been adding new titles and rounding out our offering — expanding the menu as it were. Today, however, we’re basically adding a whole new dining room (apologies for the tortured metaphor, but we’re darn hungry).</p>
<h3>You’re the captain now</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16073" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tom-hanks.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Plex users in the US will now be able to stream more individual movies than you can stream on Netflix — and in case you missed that word a few times it’s f-r-e-e. So grab the latest update for your Plex app and get crackle-ing (sorry, but we couldn’t resist).</p>

<p>Plex users in the states will also enjoy all the delicious Crackle original content, such as <em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/on-point" target="_blank&quot;" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Point</a></em>, a basketball docuseries following three high school players as they move toward their goal of an NBA career, and <em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/yelawolf-a-slumerican-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yelawolf: A Slumerican Life</a></em>, a reality-tinged journey through the life of Cherokee rapper and artist from Alabama, Yelawolf.</p>
<p>And given that Plex streams to over 200 countries around the world, we’re working on new partnerships to deliver even more <strong>free</strong> streaming content to all our friends around the world in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more on that front shortly.</p>
<h3>Rubbing elbows with the stars</h3>
<p>Okay, this is the part where we tastefully namedrop some big names. Our new Crackle offering will join movies and TV shows from the world’s biggest publishing studios, including <a href="https://www.mgm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM)</a>, <a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/company/divisions/television/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warner Bros.

<h3>We’re gonna need a bigger blog</h3>

<p>If you’re like us and you struggle with figuring out what to watch (cue the sweaty flashback to Ye Olde Blockbuster, where you stared at thousands of titles but had no idea what to get), now we have a helpful new side-blog called “<a href="https://www.plex.tv/the-watch-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Watch List</a>.” There you’ll find some fun and unreasonably-opinionated posts that dive deep into specific genres, themes, and moods. Basically a clickable, curated list of movies that you can start streaming immediately — exactly what you wish you’d had in your pocket when you were staring at 30 identical copies of The Last Action Hero at Blockbuster. Click on The Watch List icon above and read about “<a href="https://www.plex.tv/watch-list/6-heist-movies-to-steal-your-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 Heist Movies To Steal Your Heart</a>” or “<a href="https://www.plex.tv/watch-list/5-actual-laugh-out-loud-comedies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Actual Laugh-Out-Loud Comedies</a>” or “<a href="https://www.plex.tv/watch-list/3-early-films-from-future-hollywood-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 Early Films From Future Hollywood Legends</a>” until the cows come home. The current blog you know and love (or at the very least, are very currently reading) will stay the same as it ever was, and continue to bring you updates on new features and under-the-hood dives into the Plex platform.</p>
<h3>We are sweating the deets</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16078" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/look-at-me.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>While we’re excited to share today’s new cache of free awesome content, rest assured that we’re already hard at work making Plex the premier entertainment platform around the world (we know, dream big!). Keep an eye peeled for new updates in the coming months (shhh… it’s top secret but really cool) that’ll make browsing, discovering, and streaming your movies and shows even more funtastic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Um. Suffice it to say that a lot has happened since we last blogged a few months back. This may not be your typical Plex blog post, but it’ll probably be one of the least crazy things to happen today. </p>
<p>Quite a few of you have reached out to share how much Plex has helped over the past weeks and how it fits in to your shelter-in-place regimen, whether it’s keeping kids from tearing each other’s hair out, or keeping family and friends fed with a steady stream of media to pass the time. To be clear, we’re on the far fringes of being able to make a meaningful contribution to returning things to normal. While we’re not working on the cure*, we’re incredibly honored to know that we’re working on something that may make the mitigation a little more tolerable for all of you. It gives us a renewed sense of purpose. We won’t let you down.</p>
<h3>28 <del>Days</del> <del>Hours</del> Minutes Later</h3>
<p>This isn’t a Hands Across America sort of post—no false platitudes. For us, the reason we built Plex was that we always loved getting lost in stories. Movies and TV shows, documentaries and anime, old favorites as well as wild new experiences. To share a personal guilty pleasure, in times like this we’re comforted by watching really bad, really stupid, “c’mon you can’t be seriously watching that” comedies. Other people curl up with a good zombie movie. Others binge all the reality shows that seemed so trite before but now just might be able to deliver a much-needed moment of zen. Whatever your go-to jam is, we hope you get a chance to take a break every now and again. Okay! Now on to the rest of our blog.</p>
<h3>First, if you’re an educator quickly adapting to online classes, Plex might be able to help<br />
</h3>
<p>To be clear, this is a bit of a stretch for us as we’re a relatively small company, but we have a platform that might be of value to educators out there. We are aware of a number of schools (and hospitals, churches, and even a submarine!) that have used Plex to stream licensed and teacher-generated videos in classrooms. We’ve recently helped a San Francisco Bay Area school that suddenly needed to figure out how to distribute this content remotely via tablets and web browsers. We were able to donate the costs associated with the remote software, as well as provide early access to a new feature we’re working on, single item sharing, so teachers can now share their playlists or specific content directly with their classes.

<h3>A few tips on Remote Working, aka how to have a conference call in your kid’s closet</h3>
<p>From day one, we’ve been a completely remote company, working out the kinks of “working in your bedroom / dining room / garage / (hopefully sleeping) baby’s nursery” for the last 10 years. We’re spread across six different continents, so we’re well-versed in the tradeoffs of which time zone gets the short end of the stick to get up at 5 AM to make that conference call (sorry Team Australia). So at Plex, we’re all used to the hassle of video communication and with the paradise and the disaster that comes with working at home. For many of you, welcome to the new normal. If you’re new to the game, here’s <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/work-from-home?utm_source=plex&#038;utm_medium=plex-blog&#038;utm_campaign=plex-blog-this-is-fine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a great post with 47 specific WFH hacks</a> as well as a recent Forbes post (by our very own Keith Valory) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/03/25/communication-and-collaboration-the-keys-to-successful-remote-work/#6bba94212a0b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on setting up your business for WFH</a>.</p>
<h3>Okay, another thing. For the next 3 months, Live TV will be free—no Plex Pass required</h3>
<p>If you have an HD antenna and tuner, then now you can stream your free live TV to all your devices without Plex Pass through the end of June (DVR and other premium features still require a Plex Pass). And if you don’t, we got some of our hardware partners to offer them to Plex users <a href="https://www.plex.tv/ad/community-love-plex-fam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at a discount for a limited time</a>. You can stream reruns, new shows (treasure them!), news, or kids programming. Stream it all around your home or while you’re away. Maybe it will help educate, entertain, enlighten, or another e-starting-word. <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/live-tv-over-the-air-functionality-free-for-the-next-3-months/561368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Get the details here</a>. We’ve been working especially hard to fix lots of issues with Live TV based on thoughtful feedback from the community. Stay tuned for more details on that soon.<br />

<h3>(*) Other ways to help</h3>
<p>We’ll leave it to others more knowledgeable in your local communities and countries on how best to donate and support each other financially and emotionally. We do know many of you probably have some spare CPU and GPU cycles lying around, though, so we’d like to highlight an opportunity to put them to work with <a href="https://foldingathome.org/covid19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">folding@home</a> (feel free to join “<a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/249802" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Team Plex</a>” #249802 if you don’t already have a team). As they say, “Each simulation you run is like buying a lottery ticket. The more tickets we buy, the better our chances of hitting the jackpot.” So by all means, let’s go make some more lottery tickets.</p>
<h3>And if you’ve read this far, yes, we do have an Official Unofficial Plex Coloring Book for you to download</h3>
<p>The least we can do (and we mean that quite literally) is make a Plex coloring book. (Thanks again Team Australia!) After all the movies have been watched, board games have been played, podcasts have been, um, podded, and you get to that point of maximum boredom, we present to you the official unofficial Plex coloring book. Take your frustration out in colored pencil form. Print it out. Doodle. Draw. Or share your kid’s (or your) best efforts on Facebook or Instagram for a chance to earn some Plex swag. <a href="https://assets.plex.tv/marketing/coloring-book/plex-coloring-book-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.<br />

<h3>Togethertude</h3>
<p>So in closing, during this period of uncertainty, hopefully you’ve got some family with you, some friends, or at least on-screen companions reaching out from their own couches, a town, or a country over. Just know we’ll be joining you, finding a moment of escape and perhaps even the briefest but most delicious slice of joy. Stay safe out there (or more likely, in there). We’re here for you.</p>
<p>So what are your hacks for surviving indoors in this unusual new time? Let us know in the comments down below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not gonna lie, it’s been a big couple of weeks for us. We launched a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/boom-we-just-dinosized-your-movie-collection-for-free/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pretty major new thing</a> just about a week ago. It was a big effort. However, many pointed out that it’s a little bit outside of our comfort zone, and well, you’re not wrong. It’s an area of growth that we’re excited about and pushes Plex into brave, new, and exciting waters. We’re also pumped that it delivers on our long-term vision of bringing all the media you and your family enjoy into a single platform. One powerful, beautiful, and customizable platform that works smoothly and consistently no matter where and how you stream.<br />

<p>Unfortunately, as is the way of logic on the internet, some folks went on to proclaim this the “End of Plex”: it’s only a matter of time (or so the thinking goes) before we kick our loyal Media Server users to the curb in pursuit of glorious, ad-supported world domination. Well, we can very clearly state that nothing could be further from the truth. Personal media is the very core of that long-term vision, and we’re just as invested as you in making it a reality.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at some of the major improvements we’ve made over the past year.</p>
<h3>First, some core playback improvements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced and expanded playback capabilities on Android, Apple TV, and iOS.</li>
<li>Best-in-class media players on Android, iOS and Apple TV, bringing better format support, smoother playback, and overall higher quality viewing.</li>
<li>Expanded and improved support for hardware-accelerated transcoding.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next, a bunch of music-related goodness:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/find-that-tune/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Greatly improved music features</a>, scanning, and metadata.</li>
<li>TIDAL integration, including the ability to “add to library,” making TIDAL music your own.</li>
<li>Automatically find related albums and tracks for movies and TV episodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>And these are just some of the highlights among dozens of little features and hundreds of bug fixes, all in support of making Plex the best thing on the planet for your media.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to gently dispel some of the more fantastical doomsday rumors that have bubbled their way through the series of tubes. Bonus points if I can clear up some actual misconceptions along the way.</p>
<p>First, we’re as committed as ever to the needs of our media-loving, server-owning, fiercely independent community who’s been with us from the beginning. We don’t take this community for granted, and believe me, we’d sooner give up our phones (uh, no) than drive you away.</p>
<p>Second, our goal is to prioritize your personal media first, and add this new, free media as an optional supplement to you and your family. Your library is still front and center, but now there’s more to choose from if you happen to come up short. Managing multiple sources can be a bit of a tightrope act at times, and (believe it or not!) we may encounter a bug or two along the way. Have a real-world example where we got it wrong? Know that we’re listening and always trying to improve. Feedback is always welcome and appreciated. Oh, and if you or your family play things from one of these new sources, it will have no performance impact at all on your server; it comes straight from us. </p>
<p>Third—and this should <a href="https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">go without saying</a>—we do not collect information about the contents of your personal library. We do not run ads against your personal media. We don’t share this info with anyone (given we don’t know it in the first place, how could we?). Nothing here has changed with the rollout of free movies &#038; TV.</p>
<p>So there you have it. We’re excited about where this next year will take us on all fronts. As you know, everyone at Plex uses and loves the product on a daily basis. So trust us when we say that we’re continuing to build the product and the company to be something that we’re all proud of and that everyone genuinely enjoys using: old-timers, new-timers, and even the crotchety internet tube users as well. Plex is a lifelong labor of love—we thank you all for helping us dream big and keep our aim true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us are huge, huge music nerds here at Plex, so it probably makes sense that we&#8217;re always looking for ways to make music in Plex even more awesome. We&#8217;ve been hard at work on some pretty sweet improvements, and I wanted to share a little bit about them (okay, maybe a lot about them) and talk about another cool way to discover new music that we&#8217;re rolling out this week.</p>
<p>First, the tl;dr of what the recent improvements mean for your music library: Music matching and recognition is now super fast and super accurate, and for the first time there&#8217;s a way for you to <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/correcting-your-music-content-matches/">contribute and make it even better for everyone</a>. Metadata has been significantly leveled up (improved artwork! improved artist bios! styles! album reviews!). And if you&#8217;re the kind of&#8230; particular&#8230; music lover who has a perfectly organized and tagged collection, we&#8217;ve made a bunch of fixes to make sure your efforts are reflected in your Plex library. There is no longer a choice between basic and premium music libraries, everyone can take advantage of the new hotness! Basic libraries can even be seamlessly upgraded, learn how <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/upgrade-music-libraries-new-metadata-system/">here</a>.</p>
<p>But before I get into some overly-geeky details on how all that works&#8230; I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve been watching a movie or TV show and thought &#8220;this track is awesome! I wonder what it is?&#8221;, only to find myself down a Wikipedia rabbit hole, or, god forbid, watching the 15 minutes of closing credits looking for clues. Honestly, we’ve discovered some of our favorite music this way over the years, but that&#8217;s no way to live.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there&#8217;s a Better Way: we&#8217;ve harnessed the encyclopedic knowledge of the lovely community over at <a href="https://www.tunefind.com/">Tunefind</a> to bring you the answers. You can now find albums and tracks from movies and TV episodes, listed right alongside other related media, right in your Plex library! The results are powered by TIDAL (which is by itself pretty awesome—we love bringing universes of media together), so with a linked TIDAL subscription, you&#8217;ve got instant access to listen right then and there! Don&#8217;t have TIDAL? No fear, you still get those 30-second previews so you can still figure out what track you heard. This feature is now available on pretty much every platform we support, as long as you are running the latest version of our software.*</p>
<p>At launch, soundtracks and related tracks will be available, courtesy of Tunefind, and will show up for movies and TV episodes you have on your own server—your shared users don’t have access yet.</p>

<p>Okay, so how did we go about overhauling your music library? The first step was leveling up the process of scanning and recognizing all the music in your collection. It&#8217;s a surprisingly tricky task, and our existing solutions were either showing signs of age or dependent on proprietary third-party solutions that we could no longer rely on. So like any self-respecting engineer staring at an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">empty editor</a>, we looked to the internet. It turns out the folks over at <a href="https://beets.io">Beets</a> have been thinking about this exact problem for a long time, and they&#8217;ve created an amazingly capable, open source tool that provided lots of inspiration for the foundation of our new scanner. Another bit of special sauce that&#8217;s critical to identifying harder-to-recognize tracks is audio fingerprinting, a magical technology that &#8220;listens&#8221; to a few seconds of the track and searches for matches based on the actual audio instead of relying on file names or tags. For this, we turned to another open, crowd-sourced solution: <a href="https://acoustid.org">AcoustID</a>. After weaving the various pieces together, and <i>lots </i>of tuning and tweaking, we had a scanner that easily outperformed our previous efforts, posting up impressive 99%+ accuracy numbers, even on some of our more challenging test libraries full of more obscure content.</p>

<p>Historically, all of the tasty metadata that powers your Plex library has been collected by a loosely-coupled set of &#8220;agents&#8221; that live on your server, each one responsible for talking to a single metadata source, with a framework responsible for merging everything together to present the full picture. For example, plot summaries may come from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org">The Movie DB</a>, ratings from <a href="https://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>, and reviews from <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. For the most part this works great, but there are a few inherent limitations. First, each server&#8217;s agent stack can only be so smart about how it interleaves different pieces of metadata. It boils down to a stack-ranked list, so there&#8217;s no way to get, let&#8217;s say, artist bios from <a href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> but album art from <a href="https://fanart.tv/">fanart.tv</a>. Second, we&#8217;re entirely at the mercy of the original providers for the content. Even if we can all agree that the plot summary for a movie is too spoilery, or the season two poster for your favorite show looks like someone’s kid sister just learned Photoshop, we couldn&#8217;t tell the agents otherwise. Third, basically everyone just wants the best metadata we can find. It turns out they&#8217;re not interested in a part-time job managing metadata agent settings. Who could have guessed?</p>
<p>So, a huge part of the new music solution has been standing up our own metadata service in the cloud. It&#8217;s smart, and it combines the very best of both worlds. It&#8217;s seeded by the best metadata sources, both curated and crowd-sourced, and it&#8217;s expertly mixed to serve as a one-stop shop for the best music metadata on earth, easily accessible by your server in one convenient location.</p>
<p>Possibly the most important source in the music mix is <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">Musicbrainz</a>. It&#8217;s a vast wealth of music knowledge curated by a loving community who <em>really</em> care about the little things. We think it&#8217;s a perfect fit for our community, who also care about the little things, and we&#8217;re thrilled to have them as a key partner in serving up the very best metadata. In the event that you find something missing or, heaven forbid, outright wrong, you can now head over to Musicbrainz and fix it. As they say, a rising tide lifts all boats — you&#8217;ll be doing a good turn for your own library, helping the Musicbrainz community, and helping everyone else who places a value on pristine music metadata around the planet. It&#8217;s basically one step shy of some Ghandi level shit.</p>

<p>On top of Musicbrainz, we’ve also licensed what is widely considered the best-in-class <em>premium</em> metadata (used to power <a href="https://www.allmusic.com">AllMusic</a>, for example). The combination of these two sources for music data is fairly uncontroversially Best-on-Planet. And just to reiterate, this combination is available for all users now!</p>
<p>Okay. I&#8217;ve typed too much. I blame this excellent keyboard on my brand new MacBook (true story). If you&#8217;ve made it this far, you deserve to upgrade your shit, kick off some library radio, and soak up some Sweet Fades. You earned it.</p>
<p>* Plex Media Server version 1.18.2 or greater required; at launch, the feature will be available on iOS, Apple TV, Android Mobile, Android TV, and the Plex web app.</p>
<p>Here’s Barkley as a young pup, clearly already thinking of finding some doggo movie tunes.<br />

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you use music in Plex, today is a very exciting day for you, because we&#8217;re adding some ridiculously cool new features, like a killer integration with TIDAL. And if you don&#8217;t, today might just be the day you start…</p>
<p>I&#8217;m old enough to remember ripping every CD I owned, one by one, on a really slow computer. Having instant access to my entire collection felt like the future. Now that it actually is the future and everyone can easily stream just about any track, anywhere, for a few bucks a month, it’s like we’re all walking around with the library of Alexandria in our pocket (only a bit less… burney).</p>
<p>For those of us who have personal music collections, we have a conundrum. How do we keep discovering quality new music? How do we avoid losing ourselves, and our curated albums, in an infinite sea of music? How can we put technology to work for us? Well, dear reader, we&#8217;ve taken a serious run at solving those problems. We&#8217;ve partnered with TIDAL, who has a vast universe of music, most of it available in high quality FLAC, and we&#8217;ve worked out some really, really great ways to combine it with your own library.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t even need a server to enjoy TIDAL&#8217;s full catalog at your fingertips inside our Plex apps. If you&#8217;ve been on the fence about getting a Plex Pass, there&#8217;s never been a better time, as <strong><a href="https://www.plex.tv/tidal/" rel="noopener">we have some killer deals which combine a TIDAL subscription with a Plex Pass</a></strong>. With the month free trial, you can easily give it a try—dust off your music collection, check out the TIDAL catalog, buy that subwoofer, annoy your neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>Artist recommendations:</strong> On the artist page, we&#8217;ll recommend other artists you might like which aren&#8217;t in your library.<br />

<p><strong>Filling in missing albums:</strong> Huge fan of “The Sign” but missing some of Ace of Base’s newer work? No worries, Plex will show you any missing albums from the artist.<br />

<p><strong>Augmented artist radio:</strong> You know that awesome artist radio feature we added? First seen in <a href="https://plexamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plexamp</a>, Artist Radio builds a playlist of tracks from your library that captures a musical theme for a given artist. Now it’s even more awesome, as it will mix in tracks from TIDAL as well!</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-10740 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-artist-radio-2-800x646.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-artist-radio-2-800x646.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-artist-radio-2-300x242.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-artist-radio-2-768x620.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-artist-radio-2-1024x827.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-artist-radio-2-1800x1453.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-artist-radio-2-1440x1163.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-artist-radio-2-640x517.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-artist-radio-2-400x323.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-artist-radio-2-150x121.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-artist-radio-2.png 2014w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><strong>New releases for you:</strong> It&#8217;s hard to keep up with all the new releases, but we&#8217;ve made it easier, by recommending new albums from artists in your library. But only if you don&#8217;t already have them. It&#8217;s like a butler saying &#8220;sir, you may be interested in this&#8221; while you sip a Bloody Mary on the balcony in your silk dressing gown.<br />

<p><strong>Universal playlists:</strong> It&#8217;s never been easier to create the perfect playlist, as you can now mix and match from your own server, shared servers, and TIDAL.<br />
<img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-10726 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-universal-playlist-2-800x653.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-universal-playlist-2-800x653.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-universal-playlist-2-300x245.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-universal-playlist-2-768x627.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-universal-playlist-2-1024x835.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-universal-playlist-2-1440x1175.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-universal-playlist-2-640x522.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-universal-playlist-2-400x326.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-universal-playlist-2-150x122.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plex-tidal-universal-playlist-2.png 1662w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><strong>Universal Search:</strong> Hear about a new band? (Remember, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHV3tyNQ60" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">know who Arcade Fire is</a>.) Our apps now return TIDAL results alongside matches from your library, for maximum convenience.<br />

<p><strong>Discovery Radio:</strong> The Plex media server knows you, because it knows your library. It knows what music you&#8217;ve been listening to, so it can build a special playlist just for you which contains artists that are <em>not</em> already in your library, so you can discover new gems. It does not know if you’ve been naughty or nice.<br />

<p>And by the way, all you die-hard users of any other streaming music service&#8211; I mean really, almost any&#8211; there is a solid chance that you have playlists that you care deeply about and that you want to bring with you. Fear not! <a href="https://soundiiz.com/?utm_source=plex&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soundiiz</a> is the service for you: it will take your playlists and transfer them into TIDAL with just a coupla clicks of your mouse. Magic!</p>
<p>Having access to a universe of high-quality music is just one piece of the puzzle. In order to truly enjoy it, you must also have a world-class music player. If there was one thing that the <a href="https://medium.com/plexlabs/introducing-plexamp-9493a658847a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plexamp project</a> showed us, it&#8217;s that having a great player makes a huge difference. So we asked ourselves: could we bring the best features of that player to our apps, and maybe even add some additional goodness to it? Why yes, we could, and we did. Here are the highlights of the player we&#8217;re pleased to be launching today on iOS and Android mobile:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highest quality audio:</strong> Direct play of streamed FLAC, ALAC, MP3, AAC, APE and MPC. Floating point processing pipeline. For low-bandwidth scenarios, we offer best-in-class transcodes (Opus is an amazing codec).</li>
<li><strong>Gapless:</strong> For you Dave Matthews, Phish and EDM fans, you can now have seamless transitions between tracks.</li>
<li><strong>Loudness leveling:</strong> [<a href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass</a>] Normalizes audio levels between tracks and albums. You can&#8217;t live without it when you&#8217;re shuffling, unless you want to develop carpal tunnel from reaching for the volume knob.</li>
<li><strong>Sweet fades:</strong> [<a href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass</a>] Crossfades are tired. Sweet fades are wired. Dumb crossfades just overlap tracks by a fixed amount; our sweet fades compute the optimal crossover point between every single pair of tracks and use that to deliver an ear-delighting mix.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced hybrid caching:</strong> Especially in mobile environments, caching ahead is key! Our player not only caches the entire current track to disk, but will read ahead the entire next track as well, to ensure continuous playback even across network transitions and glitches. The cache also stores recently played tracks so you can avoid cellular usage when possible. Keep the music playing!</li>
<li><strong>Soft pauses:</strong> Details matter. We do a gentle fade out/in when you&#8217;re pausing. Life is harsh, interruptions to your music shouldn&#8217;t be.</li>
<li><strong>Silence compression:</strong> [<a href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass</a>] Ever listen to a podcast where there&#8217;s quite a bit of dead air? Our advanced silence compression feature shrinks periods of silence in spoken word content like Podcasts. Often you&#8217;ll see a 10% speedup with virtually no perceptible difference. And remember, time is the most valuable thing.</li>
<li><strong>Voice boost:</strong> [<a href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass</a>] Interesting fact: not every podcast producer has high quality studio equipment and trained audio engineers on staff. Not to worry though, our sophisticated voice-boosting compression algorithm makes it seem like they do.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have one more little goodie for you, which should hopefully show you how obsessed we are with making your music experience amazing. We added artist radio to give you the ability to get a great mix from a bunch of different artists, but what if you just want to listen to a single artist? Enter <em>Magic Artist Shuffle</em>. We&#8217;ve rewritten the naive shuffle to take into account your listening history, track ratings, popularity, duplicate tracks, and more.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! This blog post is dedicated to you, the devoted user. The one who’s been with us since early days, meticulously curating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few terabytes</a> of media goodness. The one who would be happy to see us focus on stability and core functionality, and do a bit of house cleaning along the way.</p>
<p>For years now (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/rob-lowe-literally-ama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">li-ter-ah-ly</a>) you’ve have been asking for a way to get <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/subtitle-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtitles</a> without having to go back to the computer, submit to dubious popup ads, move the subs into place, refresh the media, get distracted by a half-eaten hoagie in the fridge. Sorry, where was I? Oh right, so we’re pleased to announce a feature which makes it so easy to find and enable a subtitle, <em>you don’t even have to leave the couch</em>. We use all sorts of smarts to find you the best matches in all sorts of languages (half of all Plexians are outside the US). <strong>This feature will be rolling out as Plex Pass Preview over the next few days</strong> as we fine tune it on Web Desktop, Xbox One, most LG TVs, Plex Media Player, Android mobile, and Android TV (iOS and Apple TV will follow up shortly).</p>

<em>Android TV</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plex has been around for the better part of a decade, and software has a way of behaving like your garage: You had every intention of keeping it neat and organized, but every nook is somehow filled with Star Wars figurines and Amiibos. So it’s critical to hold the occasional yard sale and get rid of all the accumulated cruft. It’s not an uncommon thing for a software company to do—Apple does it (et tu, OpenGL?), and so does Google (RIP Inbox, Reader).</p>
<p>The Plex ecosystem is quite large, and over the years, we’ve sometimes added things that might have made sense at the time, but didn’t age well. We’ve also been <em>incredibly</em> reluctant to take anything away from people who may be using a given feature. Or kill support for a platform with low usage or other challenges. And while any given case might not be significant, they can add up over a decade to a death by a thousand (paper) cuts. So we set out to do some house-cleaning&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn’t approach the process lightly; we looked over usage numbers and took into account maintenance costs and general customer satisfaction. In some cases, we have plans for a future in which a better replacement shows up. Other things, we’re just stabbing in the chest repeatedly with a wooden stake (and hoping it’s not a zombie). But the philosophy is the same—<em>we want to focus our finite energy on providing awesome functionality that works great and makes the folks who use it happy</em>. Without further ado, here’s the list of things we’re retiring:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Plugins</strong>: This was not a decision taken lightly, as they’ve been around for a long time, and we’ve had good times both writing and using them. But bluntly, hardly anyone uses them (less than 2% of users), the ancient protocol they use is a continued pain for clients to support, and if we were to build the feature again, we’d do it very differently in this day and age. For utility-type functionality, we love standalone apps like <a href="https://tautulli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tautulli</a> and believe this is a better approach. But don’t panic—while the Plugin Directory will soon be gone, you can still manually install plugins for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Watch Later</strong>: There’s a small handful of you who still care about this feature – just enough to form a close-knit support group – and we’re super sorry (really) if this disrupts your daily bookmarking, but the feature is costly for us to maintain, and hard to justify in the long run.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: There is very low usage, and it’s also built atop an antediluvian sync engine, so if you rely on Cloud Sync for your day-to-day, things aren’t pretty. DM us a photo of your Cloud Sync library and today’s newspaper and we’ll buy you a beer? (no, not really).</p>
<p>Lastly, as we’ve previously announced, we’re shuttering our hosted Plex Media Server in the cloud (Plex Cloud) as of November 30. For those of you who relied on the service, please accept our heartfelt apology.</p>
<p>So with all that house-cleaning out of the way, what else have we been doing with our newfound laser focus (and laser-equipped sharks? shh… that’s Phase Two)? A lot of good stuff, actually.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Making Sync Great <del datetime="2018-09-25T15:08:31+00:00">Again</del></strong>: We realize that over the years, our vaunted (and premium) offline sync feature hasn’t always worked as reliably as we would have hoped. We decided to form a Seal Team 6 style group tasked with assassinating as many sync bugs as they could, working with client and server groups, as well as with forum users. The team has already made great headway on fixing some of the most annoying bugs, and you’ll begin to see the fruits of their labor across the next wave of updates.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Making Players Play</strong>: We’ve convened a similar squadron of sauron-eyed swashbucklers to kill bugs in the new Android player engine. Yes, it’s awesome that it Direct Plays everything under the sun, but that doesn’t matter if it randomly stops playing Bachelor in Paradise right as Jenna is about to punch Jordan in the face. Also: that show is everything that is wrong about humans.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>The Sound of Music</strong>: Oh, and clamp down hard on your tuks, because we have some amazing music player improvements in the works. I don’t want to give too much away, but if it rhymes with schmapless, it may be coming to a platform near you. :mic-drop:</p>
<p>In conclusion, we’re working hard to improve our focus, spend time on things that matter the most, remove as many distractions as possible, improve stability of the core product, and launch more kick-ass features. Thanks for your feedback!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s always difficult to choose whether you want to stay in to catch up on the shows and movies you’ve been meaning to watch or spending time with friends when the weather is tolerable. Do I stay at home to work on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn4QyOoaOIo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">night cheese</a> or do I go out into the world and have new experiences? With <a href="https://www.plex.tv/your-media/virtual-reality/"  >Plex VR</a> you don’t have to choose, you can <em>Watch Together</em> while you enjoy the next movie in your media library, but that’s <em>old</em> news&#8230;we’ve made VR <em>even better</em>.</p>
<h3>Cross-platform Support for Watch Together</h3>
<p>Continuing our platform-agnosticism, the <em>Watch Together</em> feature works across all supported platforms, now including <a href="https://support.plex.tv/plex-vr-gear-vr/"  >Gear VR and Oculus Go</a>! So regardless of what you or your friends own, you don’t need to have a brand holy war to watch together. (Key word there is <em>need</em>.)</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/plex-vr-watch-together-2-800x450.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-10432 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/plex-vr-watch-together-2-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/plex-vr-watch-together-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/plex-vr-watch-together-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/plex-vr-watch-together-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/plex-vr-watch-together-2-1800x1013.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/plex-vr-watch-together-2-1440x810.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/plex-vr-watch-together-2-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/plex-vr-watch-together-2-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/plex-vr-watch-together-2-150x84.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE.</p>
<h3>Virtual Surround Sound</h3>
<p>Plex VR now features VIRTUAL Surround Sound (5.1) for <a href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass-o/"  >Plex Pass</a> subscribers! What the hell does that mean? The audio from your stereo headphones is going to magically sound like you have the most lavish home theater speakers practically surrounding&#8211;<em>no</em>, more like stalking your ears. The audio will feel as if it’s enveloping you in a warm hug. Seriously, it’s like <em>virtually</em> having the best speakers that money can buy (for under a grand&#8230;let’s be sensible).</p>
<p>We’re making history with VR by bringing you a social experience with widespread platform support for <em>Watch Together</em> AND Virtual Surround Sound. All you have to do is suppress your fear of missing out and indulge staying in with Plex VR; <em>unless</em> you want to wear your gear outside &#8212; <em>you do you</em>, friend.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Music makes us <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-music-make-us-fe/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feel</a>. It can move us to tears, remind us of a specific time and place in the past, or lift us up when we’re down. It’s even <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-music-can-help-you-heal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good for your health</a>!</p>
<p>Kids these days might not realize it, but not that long ago, playing music consisted of physically placing a large dark vinyl disc on a spinning platter and then precisely positioning a needle on the disc. You couldn’t make a playlist, shuffle an album, or skip tracks from across the room.<br />
The advent of the 8-track (really the cassette) heralded the era of the Mix Tape. You still couldn’t shuffle, but you could <em>finally</em> put together a custom sequence of songs. This was truly a revolution, because music is deeply personal; different artists speak to us differently, due to some mysterious combination of nature and nurture we don’t fully understand yet. Anna doesn’t care for the Wu-Tang Clan (not even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Shaolin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost Shkreli album</a>), while I am not much of a Belieber.</p>
<p>Next came the era of Winamp. I still remember <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ripping</a> stacks of CDs so I could have my entire collection of music at my fingertips. Oh, the freedom! Oh the playlists, one for every occasion! And then came iTunes, which for the most part just made you familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_pinwheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spinning pinwheel</a>, but helped you bring your music with you on your phone and taught you how to upgrade your RAM.</p>
<p>As we talked about <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-media-server-a-retrospective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the last post</a>, Plex started with a strong focus on movies and TV shows. Since then, we’ve spent considerable effort and resources in making it a great place for your music. I still remember moving over from iTunes (I know, right?) after our <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-music-goes-eleven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive music feature launch</a> in 2015, and I’ve honestly never looked back. I wanted to highlight a few of the best features of Plex Music, keeping an eye to the future. We are fortunate to have people here at Plex who are not only music lovers, but also incredibly smart and innovative thinkers (looking at you, Ben!), and we’re going to continue to invest in making Plex awesome for music.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immaculate_Collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Immaculate Collection:</strong></a> At last count, I have 148 days of music in my library (4,754 albums, if you must know). Plex quickly picks up any new albums I add, nearly always flawlessly matching using the Gracenote-powered fingerprinting available with a Plex Pass upgrade. I usually view my collection by album so I see the new ones appear and can make adjustments to pick the best album art, tweak the occasional track name, or use the <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/beginning-look-lot-like-collections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly upgraded collections feature</a> to link certain albums to movies or TV shows. If I’m in the mood I add music videos, which Plex also displays beautifully alongside the tracks. Another premium feature I use a lot is <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/215238778-automatic-lyrics-from-lyricfind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lyrics</a>, which helps you sing along or figure out what a singer is mumbling about (spoiler alert: Hendrix doesn’t actually say “Excuse me while I kiss this guy”)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here,_There_and_Everywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Here, There, and Everywhere:</strong></a> Now that Plex has my music, I can access it from anywhere on the planet.

I also detailed <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-media-server-a-retrospective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my sync strategy</a> for music in the last blog, which ensures I always have a great mix of new music and old favorites, even when on a plane, submarine, or spacecraft (Plex Pass required, spacecraft oddly not).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Across the Universe:</strong></a> We’ve been adding support for more and more devices and platforms: you can now use a Chromecast Audio, Amazon Alexa, or a Sonos to play your tunes, and Alexa can play on the device or remote control other Plex players. We also added support for <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/androids-dream-plex-car/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Auto</a> to allow for safer Plex music while driving. Plus, we’re pleased to announce that today the latest release of <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/categories/plex-apps/sonos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex for Sonos</a> is out of beta. It’s all-new—much faster, more reliable, and with more features.<br />

<p>I found a bunch of videos of dogs <em>allegedly</em> rocking out to music on YouTube, but that seems like fake pet news. I’ve never seen Barkley express any preference or distaste for music, although in my heart of hearts, I know he’s a hip-hop sort of a dog.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been close to two years since <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/long-winding-road-v1-0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we released Plex Media Server v1.0</a>, and we figured it was time to highlight just a few of the things we&#8217;ve been working on since then. If you thought we’ve just been <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/rest-on-his-laurels.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">growing Laurus Nobilis trees</a> and chilling on piles of their leaves, you&#8217;d be well mistaken. By the numbers alone, we’ve closed 2,281 issues (thanks, <a href="https://github.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!) and made 3,456 commits to the code since then. We have a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/about/careers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">growing server team</a> (if you know the difference between <a href="https://www.boost.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">boost</a> and a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=booster+seat" rel="noopener" target="_blank">booster seat</a>, drop us a line!). In that time, we’ve made the server faster, added some incredibly cool features, and fixed a ton of bugs. Let&#8217;s recap A FEW of the more exciting things we&#8217;ve added!</p>
<p><a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/201273953-collections/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Collections</a>: Noted in our satisfaction survey (yes, we have the feels for you!) as one of your favorite new features, we added this as a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/beginning-look-lot-like-collections/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Christmas present</a> last year. It allows you to group things together and add custom titles and artwork (even across libraries and media types—we&#8217;re especially proud of our Blade Runner collection: all the cuts plus the soundtrack!). We&#8217;re about to release a nice little update which adds frequently requested per-collection visibility settings, and we have another little treat planned as well. We know you love collecting and curating media, and we&#8217;re going to keep building the best way for you to do it!<br />

<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/photos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Photos</a>: Many of you might not know this, but the original design for the media server library was sketched on a napkin in coach class on a long flight from Korea to Hawaii. The library was designed to be generic, but it wasn&#8217;t until fairly recently that we really focused on making sure the Server was the best software in the world for organizing your prized digital photos. We added support for <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/put-photos-map/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">location tagging</a>, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/heart-your-photos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">favoriting</a>, and some <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/introducing-new-game-photo-tag/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crazy auto-tagging magic</a> for <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plex Pass</a> users, with beautiful new waterfall-style views, and more.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/music/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Music</a>: It&#8217;s a brave new world for music these days on Plex! As part of <a href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-labs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plex Labs</a>, we released a little app called <a href="https://medium.com/plexlabs/introducing-plexamp-9493a658847a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plexamp</a> to showcase a bunch of wicked cool new server-powered music features, including new Radio stations from tracks in your own library, visual seeking, smart crossfading, <a href="https://plexamp.com/#help" rel="noopener" target="_blank">and more</a>. Many of these features are making their way to other apps including our Alexa skill, the Roku app, and others. We also added a super powerful smart playlist builder to the web app. If you have a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plex Pass</a>, here&#8217;s a really cool combination of smart playlists you can sync to your mobile devices:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Recently Added</em>: This one is easy, just sort by addition date</li>
<li><em>Highly Rating, Haven&#8217;t Listened Recently:</em> Make another playlist of highly rated tracks, and select ones which you haven’t listened to in—say—3 months</li>
</ul>

<p>Next up, sync these two smart playlists to your mobile device; you can tweak the amount of each by setting an appropriate limit on the sync rule. Now you have a perfect collection with you at all times! </p>
<ul>
<li>Your most recently added music in case you&#8217;re in the mood for new stuff.</li>
<li>Music you love but haven’t heard lately in case you’re in the mood for the familiar.</li>
<li>Shuffle all your synced music to get a great mix of new and old favorites!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Under the hood</strong>: <em>Deep</em> inside the Plex Media Server (second basement level, down the hall and third door on the left) is an incredibly sophisticated piece of software called the <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/mcstreamy-brain-take-world-two-easy-steps" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Streaming Brain</a>. As promised, it keeps getting smarter. Along with the Plex Transcoder (based on the <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most advanced transcoder</a> in the solar system), these two systems ensure you have the best experience no matter what hotel-, airplane-, or questionable cafe- WiFi is between you and your media.</p>
<p>Starting on the server, we&#8217;ve added extensive support for <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/115002178853-using-hardware-accelerated-streaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hardware-accelerated transcoding</a> (in layperson&#8217;s terms: making your lazy-ass CPU or video card work harder for you). Practically speaking, it means you can stream more things at the same time. But regardless of how powerful a system you have (or how many sweet, sweet RGB LEDs you have on it — looking at you, Ian), you’re probably limited by your upstream bandwidth. This is where the Streaming Brain shines, as it now manages your bandwidth across multiple streams, and picks the optimal quality for each stream individually, modifying as needed on-the-fly. No hyperbole, this is the most sophisticated media server ever built.<br />

<p><strong>Rapid Fire</strong>: We could go on for a while, but we’ll just leave you with a few other things which may have slipped through the cracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>We added an advanced caching system to ensure dashboards and discovery screens load quickly, regardless of your library size. Speedups range from 4x to 100x.</li>
<li>We were annoyed that we didn’t even notice the new season of the Walking Dead had started, so we enhanced the On Deck feature to include season premieres.</li>
<li>We added powerful customization features so that you can automatically delete older TV episodes (or clean them up after watching), set sort order for a show or artist, or enable DVD order for shows.</li>
<li>Everyone loves <del datetime="2018-04-27T02:42:34+00:00">torturing</del> delighting shared users with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/78a9q4/rplexs_preroll_megathread/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">custom pre-roll trailers</a>. We recently <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/202920803-extras/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">enhanced the feature</a> to give you more control over the trailers you serve up. Clearly you need to push that popcorn and then sell overpriced soda to your dry-mouthed audience.</li>
<li>For those of you a bit more technically inclined, we added support for <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/115002267687-webhooks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Webhooks</a>. We&#8217;ve seen them used to control home theater lighting, <a href="https://github.com/plexinc/webhooks-slack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post movie and TV plays to Slack</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/plexinc/plex-slack-music-notifications" rel="noopener" target="_blank">keep Slack status updated</a> with current music track. Let us know if you’ve found a cool use for Webhooks!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wise person once said “a single ecosystem does not an emerging technology establish.” An even wiser person once said “three ecosystems oughta be enough for anyone.” The wisest of all once said “you should totally not be allowed to give a one-star rating because an app’s not available on a different platform!” Well guess what? We appreciate a good aphorism and we couldn’t agree more. </p>
<p>A few months ago we launched our awesome Plex VR app, and amazing though it was, it was only available on the Daydream platform. It turns out we can count quite a few Gear VR and Oculus fans among the ranks of avid Plexians, and of course we aim to please. Yes, even those of you who bucked the wisest person’s golden rule of app store reviews. We still love you.</p>

<p>But in all seriousness, these new platforms are amazing. The second-wisest person was probably on to something: with so many healthy ecosystems springing up around VR, each with its own strengths, it’s probably safe to say VR is here to stay. Of course we haven’t forgotten our roots, and we’re always working to improve our Daydream experience, too. We really appreciate all the great feedback on the app!</p>

<p><em>FYI, Watch together, including Voice Chat on Plex VR will be available on Gear VR within a few weeks. We are working hard to make it happen for you!</em></p>
