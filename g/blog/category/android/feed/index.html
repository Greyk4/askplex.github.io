										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>First, the backstory. Remember TV?</h3>
<p>In the beginning, there was TV. And TV was good. It worked like this—you walked into a room, you turned it on, something started playing, and you sat down. Were there choices? Sure. Depending on which decade you spent your formative years in, it coulda been four. Didn’t like what was on that particular channel? Well, you could stand up, turn the dial, and maaaaaybe find something better on. Then the remote came along and with it, channel surfing. And that was also good. All of a sudden you had twenty, thirty, even forty different choices. Turns out, there was usually “something good” on.</p>
<div class="responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/440042479" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<h3>Programming via fax machine</h3>
<p>We loved it because it was simple and we hated it because it was simple. You didn’t have to make a lot of decisions. And there was always something next. There was even a job at TV networks called “the programmer.” And the programmers would stay up all night and debate what was the exact order that shows should be shared with you. Each morning every studio executive would get a fax at five in the morning with something called “the overnights.” And they would know whether or not they had done their job DJ’ing your TV selection as their morning coffee brewed.</p>
<h3>And now, for some breaking news, we go live</h3>

<p>Today Plex is bringing it all back (except for the fax machine, still working on that integration) with free Live TV for everyone, in all 220+ countries that Plex serves. With over <strong>80+ channels</strong> (plus even more coming soon) across all your favorite genres. And this is in addition to the 14,000 (and counting) free movies, documentaries, and TV shows you can find on Plex on-demand, so there’s always something on to fit your mood. Whether it’s live news like <strong>Reuters</strong>, or kids shows like <strong>Toon Goggles</strong>, cooking shows on <strong>Tastemade</strong>, or sports on <strong>fubo Sports Network</strong>, or even eSports on <strong>IGN TV</strong>, we’ve got you covered.</p>
<h3>P.S. all you cord-cutters—add Antenna TV + Live TV and you get Ultimate TV</h3>
<p>If you’re a Plex antenna TV user, then you already know the joys of cord-cutting. With an antenna, tuner, and Plex Pass, many of you already use Plex to stream live local TV to all your devices. Now we’ve expanded your live TV offering for the best of all worlds—free on-demand movies, live local TV, and <strong>80+ streams</strong> of free TV—just to make sure you bathe in the golden rays of television at all times. Look for future improvements to provide options to make navigating the grid even easier and more intuitive.</p>
<h3>Broaden your horizons</h3>

<p>Now you can tune into an entire channel where Bob Ross teaches you how to paint landscapes (on—what else—<strong>The Bob Ross Channel</strong>), one carefree stroke after another. Go on a surf safari with <strong>Surf Now TV</strong>, or learn how to up your dating game on <strong>Love Destination.</strong></p>

<p>Finding safe and sane kids programming is often a challenge for busy parents (some of whom have unfortunately had the disconcerting discovery of what Junior has stumbled onto in that epic four-hour YouTube binge). Now we have fun options for the whole gang like <strong>Kidoodle TV</strong>, <strong>Monster Kids</strong>, <strong>KidsFlix</strong> (noticing a theme yet?), <strong>Squad</strong>, <strong>Toon Goggles</strong>, and <strong>Toon Goggles Jr</strong>. Sweet wholesome serenity (with just enough sliming to keep it real).</p>

<p>If my Google Translate was working properly, here’s where I’d write something super witty in Spanish about our new Spanish language feeds, but let’s just all agree, it’s going to be muy caliente with such offerings as <strong>AFV Español</strong> and <strong>Latin X Pop</strong>. Additionally, there is <strong>BAMBU</strong> for top Chinese entertainment, <strong>KMTV</strong> for all things K-pop, and <strong>AsianCrush</strong> and <strong>YUYU TV</strong> for streams that encompass entertainment far and beyond.</p>

<p>The boat show? Yep, if you’re into boats—or you want to sound like <a href="https://youtu.be/a7NarmrZeC4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a guy who just bought a boat</a>—then now there’s <strong>The Boat Show</strong>. Is there a time and place to watch a network exclusively dedicated to boats? We also have <strong>Choppertown</strong> for those who like to <a href="https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/09/19/heres-a-florida-man-driving-a-street-legal-jet-ski-on-the-highway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drive boats on two wheels down a road</a>.

<p>Hey, remember when MTV stood for Music Television instead of, um, the worst of human behavior in bite-sized reality-TV flavored chunks? Well, now you can bring back your own favorite TRL (shout out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AbSd9zd_M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carson Daly</a>!) for your favorite genres: watch everything from <strong>80s Party</strong> to <strong>Party Tyme Karaoke</strong> to <strong>Texas-Sized Hits</strong> and <strong>Electro Anthems</strong>. But wait, what’s that you say? Hold the champagne, put a pause on the Grey Poupon—“Will Plex have the <strong>Yacht Rock</strong> channel?” You bet your sweet docksiders we do! (And whichever therapist told you that you could watch a Bob Seger video too many times, well, they’re just plain wrong.)</p>

<p>Yeah, well you can skip all that now.</p>

<h3>Binge-watching nirvana</h3>
<p>Introducing our brand new Plex Pass feature called (duh) Skip Intro. If you’ve ever binge-watched anything, you know the secret to achieving that smooth multi-episode groove is all about reducing the non-essentials. So our engineers sharpened their pencils and, um, slid their slide-rules in order to figure out how to dynamically skip intros for basically any type of show. That is, without having to manually identify on every single episode what is an opening intro and what is just a kick-ass music break at the start of an episode. When you add in cold-opens, different credits for different seasons, and regional variations, it starts to become a rather thorny problem. </p>
<p>Long story short, we updated your Plex Media Server to analyze your shows in the background in order to deliver some next-level pattern recognition. Once it&#8217;s finished processing, you&#8217;ll see that friendly <strong>Skip Intro</strong> button appear in your supported player app. Magic.</p>
<h3>To boldly go where no DVR has gone before</h3>
<p>Think of it as another reason to get that digital antenna and tuner and set up Plex Live TV and DVR. In addition to watching and recording dozens of HD over-the-air broadcast channels for FREE (here in the States that includes networks like CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX, and PBS plus dozens more depending on your local market), now you can skip intros on all of your recorded shows. Only two caveats: the intro sequence must be at least 20 seconds long (keep reading to see why) and you’ll need a Plex Pass for your playback device. As of today, you’ll see it working on the latest releases of our iOS, Android, Roku, Fire TV, and Web clients – once you’ve updated your Plex Media Server and let it process your TV content.</p>
<h3>Show me the histograms</h3>
<p>A little peek under the hood: The secret ingredient is creating an audio &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; out of the histogram of each episode in a given season of each TV show. It turns out that the vast majority of show intros share common audio signatures for all their episodes (at least for a specific season). After applying some heuristics and a little bit of Special Sauce<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, we&#8217;re able to predict (in almost all cases) precisely when the intro starts and ends. Voila! Get precious minutes of your life back, one episode at a time.<br />

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We started Plex Labs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-labs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">just over two years ago</a> to provide, among other things, a playground for new apps (both our own, as well as 3rd-party apps that struck our fancy) that build on our awesome media platform. Plex can be like a fractal—everyone has their own view of what the most important parts of the platform are, and you can zoom into any one of these and spend a lifetime working on perfecting and improving that little area. In other words, a thousand zen gardens&#8230;</p>
<h3>A Brand New Plexamp</h3>
<h4>“The only kind of writing is rewriting” – Ernest Hemingway</h4>
<p>When we first launched Plex Labs, our first release was Plexamp, a tiny, highly opinionated desktop music player. But after a year of updates, things went quiet. Had we abandoned it? Was the llama tired of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-slogan-of-Winamp-whip-the-llamas-ass-mean-for-you">being whipped</a>? Had the zen garden suddenly filled with weeds? Nope. Inspired by the promise of the first releases, and our shared love with Hemingway of a <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/hemingway-daiquiri-recipe-760527">great daiquiri</a>, we decided to <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">rewrite the whole thing from scratch</a>, add a ton of features, and then release it (today? Sure why not!) on five platforms: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
<h4>One hundred and ten is the magic number</h4>
<p>We’re calling the new version 3.0 (although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x">3.11</a> might have been more appropriate) and there are so many new features that we’ve written an entire <a href="https://medium.com/plexlabs/plexamp-v3-9af3b10063b4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medium post</a> about them. If you already use music on Plex, you’re going to love it. And if you don’t, maybe it’s time to give it a try?</p>
<p>Over the last year, our small group of fearless testers has gone through 110 (that’s <em>one-hundred-and-ten</em>) betas, and it might be easiest to let their words speak for themselves:</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; font-style: italic; margin-top: -40px !important; text-align: center; color: #868c96;">To our eyes, it doesn’t suck.</p>
<p>The new version of Plexamp is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/purchase?plan=monthly&#038;utm_source=Plex&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_content=pp_plexamp_inline&#038;utm_campaign=Plex+Labs+April+15+2020+nonPP" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass</a> only. And if you need further incentive to go ahead and grab that glorious Plex Pass, Plexamp isn’t the only app we’re launching today&#8230;</p>
<h3>Introducing Plex Dash</h3>
<h4>A dash of power</h4>
<p>As you might imagine, plenty of us here at Plex run our own personal media servers and like keeping a close eye on them. So why not a single-purpose app dedicated to server administration? Like many things in the history of Plex, the genesis of Plex Dash involved scratching some itches. First of all, we wanted a beautiful way to see all playbacks, even across multiple servers; something you might repurpose an old iPad for, duct taping it to a wall in your secret lair. Something to gaze at while you stroke your hairless cat. You know the drill.</p>
<p>Secondly, we wanted a fun way for you to help edit your artwork and make your library even lovelier during any spare moment: one-handed while wrangling the kids, or in a few minutes of downtime between video calls. And last, but not least, we wanted raw administrative power: scan for new media, fix incorrect matches, check on server resource usage, tweak library settings, even view server logs live.</p>
<p>Plex Dash is built on top of the same codebase as Plexamp – check out  this <a href="https://medium.com/plexlabs/plex-dash-c42d1f624877" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medium post</a> for more details about its many features. Plex Dash is available for all <a href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/purchase?plan=monthly&#038;utm_source=Plex&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_content=pp_plex_dash_inline&#038;utm_campaign=Plex+Labs+April+15+2020+nonPP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plex Pass</a> holders today, on iOS and Android.</p>

<h3>Apps for days</h3>
<p>So we’re super excited to share these two Plex Lab apps. Because they’re lab-born, we’ll continue to tinker with them, and you should keep in mind that they are not officially supported. But if you’re excited to check them out, head to your friendly neighborhood app store (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Plex+Labs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/plex-labs/id1500797509" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a>) or our brand new <a href="https://plexamp.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plexamp.com</a> site (for the desktop apps), take them for a spin, and let us know what you think in our <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/c/testing/plex-labs">Plex Labs forum</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago we <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/remastered-thanks-to-you-our-brand-new-tv-navigation-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spelled out</a> some imminent changes to our TV UI, and intimated that great things were to come across the board. “UNO is the future!” we said (“UNO” being our internal code name for the new UI paradigm across all platforms). None of us quite knew why “UNO” was capitalized since it’s not an acronym. “Blame Jason!” we said, and Jason was asleep at the time, so we went with it.</p>
<h3>So what is all this hullabaloo about UNO anyway?</h3>
<p>In case you missed it, UNO is our latest effort to streamline the process of searching, discovering and enjoying your content in your Plex library—no matter the type, no matter the source, no matter the format. It’s an easy, elegant, and powerful system that’s consistent no matter where and how you Plex. It gives you the ultimate control over how you navigate your collection.</p>
<h3>Benefits include: Niftier navigation</h3>
<p>We restore some basic usability qualities that suffered a bit under our “type-first” implementation.</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/navigating-the-big-screen-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fewer clicks to get where you want to go.</a></li>
<li>More discoverable actions and sources.</li>
<li>More intuitive navigation patterns.</li>
<li>Fewer distractions with things you shouldn’t have to care about.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A powerful new sidebar</h3>
<p>In addition to being a better use of screen space than the top menu, it lets you see all the stuff you care about, none of the stuff you don’t, and it gets out of the way when you don’t need to look at it.</p>
<h3>Rolling out wide across the Plexverse</h3>
<p>Fast forward a few months, and now we’re on the precipice of realizing that very vision: the UNO UI is rolling out across all TV platforms this week, it’s <em>super</em> close on iOS and coming thereafter on Android, but importantly this marks the mainstream release of our most sacred (and challenging!) release of all: our beloved Web app.</p>
<h3>Which brings us to our friendly neighborhood Web app</h3>
<p>The Plex Web app is a bit of a special beast, since it serves as both a super popular platform for consuming media and the singular app to admin and curate your Media Servers. We’re fairly confident this app embodies the best of both worlds: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-plex-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimate customization</a> for the media consumer and improved control and curation for the server owner and administrator. It’s always a fun balancing act between the two—and many thanks to everyone who has given feedback along the way.</p>

<p>So go forth and customize! Embrace the sources you love best! Relegate the others to the “More” menu! (It’s okay, I’m pretty sure they won’t be offended <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f937-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) The reins of your media future rest loosely in your hands… YAH!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahoy Plexverse! We hope the season finds you well (hot and beachy in the northern hemisphere, cool and snow-shoey in the southern). Life here is good, we’ve been heads-down on fixing bugs and adding features, as always. The new <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/remastered-thanks-to-you-our-brand-new-tv-navigation-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNO</a> UI is coming to more platforms, we’re intensely focused on a giant metadata overhaul that we’re really excited about, we’ve added the ability to cast to SONOS devices and support for third-party Alexa-powered devices, and we’ve stomped some especially annoying server bugs: Live TV timeouts, several elusive crashes, some cases where we didn’t fall back from hardware to software transcoding, and some major improvements (orders of magnitude in fact) to partial scanning on some larger libraries, among others.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-11932 lazy" style="border-bottom: solid 1px #E0E3E6; padding-bottom: 0px !important;" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-800x445.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-800x445.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-768x427.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-1024x570.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-1800x1002.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-1440x801.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-640x356.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-400x223.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-150x83.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>One thing we’ve been wanting to add for eons now is server notifications. Literally for so long that when we started talking about it, push notifications didn’t exist and we would have had to use pagers. Sadly there are <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382578/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very few titles</a> which are pager-friendly and thankfully along came real push notifications.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11938" style="width: 100%;" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-plex-knows-notifications-pager.gif" alt="" /><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: .9em;">&#8220;Can I ask you a question? Do you know if the hotel is pager-friendly?&#8221; <em>The Hangover</em></span></p>
<p>We’ve been honing this feature for a while, and we’re finally launching it today! Super easy to get up and running—just flip the switch in your Media Server settings, and you’ll start getting notifications for new On Deck media and a few critical server maintenance events. Head over to your iOS or Android device and you can customize the notifications you’d like to receive to your heart’s content. Want to be notified any time your kid plays something? No problem! Want to know about all the movies your hipster cinephile sister adds to her server? Go for it. New media notifications work great for shared servers and users, too!</p>
<div><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-notification-screens-800x590.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-11948 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-notification-screens-800x590.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-notification-screens-300x221.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-notification-screens-768x567.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-notification-screens-1024x756.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-notification-screens-1800x1329.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-notification-screens-1440x1063.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-notification-screens-640x472.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-notification-screens-400x295.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-notification-screens-150x111.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></div>
<p>We’ve also added notifications around some key server maintenance tasks you can opt into, such as notifying you when your database is backed up, or for our security-minded server admins, new users accessing your server for the first time from a new device. Note: new content and server notifications are only sent for servers that have opted in.</p>
<p>For the automation fans out there, these new events will also trigger webhooks, so you can use them for all sorts of cool projects. Build something neat with webhooks? Let us know so we can feature it!</p>
<p>Push notifications are available now as a Plex Pass preview. Make sure your Plex Media Server is signed in with an active Plex Pass, grab the latest Media Server, ensure your iOS and Android apps are up to date, and get pushing! Find out more juicy details on <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/push-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our support site</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it’s already April, which somehow scored the three biggest holidays of the year. Seriously, March and August have got to be facepalming themselves with frustration, wondering how April got all the coolness. What other month do you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay the piper</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2019/apr/01/april-fools-day-2019-the-best-jokes-and-pranks-in-one-place" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fool the piper</a>, and <a href="https://giphy.com/explore/420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smoke the piper</a> all within a thirty-day blur?</p>
<p>It also means April happens to be the perfect time to talk about how we’ve added a bit more kick to our already-tasty TIDAL x Plex musical brew with some spicy new enhancements. And to demonstrate exactly how smooth and flavorful this cocktail is, watch as we serve it up to an unsuspecting music aficionado whose universe – and quite possibly his very conception of reality – is about to be completely rocked in sixty seconds flat.</p>

<h3>In which we introduce Hector, the hero of our story</h3>
<p>Meet my friend Hector. He’s what you call a <a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/who-are-the-musicians-musicians.497702/page-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">musician’s musician</a>. As well as a fan’s fan. And of course he’s <em>also</em> a waiter’s waiter because, well, the first two things.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hector has been using Plex for well on three and a half years. And he likes to tell me (in between the <em>amuse bouche</em> and the <em>antipasto</em> courses at the rather delicious Italian restaurant he’s working at) that he loves Plex and has tweaked all of his album art to make his library a living monument to Shag (the <a href="http://www.shag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artist</a>, not the <a href="https://flashbak.com/shag-carpet-and-the-sleazy-seventies-19216/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">carpet</a>, though at a certain point in the evening it all kinda becomes one and the same in an <a href="http://www.faberhama.com/Ouroboros-Rug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ouroboros</a> sorta way). After he sweeps away our garlic-soaked crumbs, Hector declares that he is a huge fan of Steely Dan (the band, not William S. Burrough’s prop that, er, electrifies the masterful <em>Naked Lunch</em>).</p>
<p>And I say to him (YES WITH MY MOUTH FULL BECAUSE THIS POINT IS <em>THAT</em> IMPORTANT) “Sure, right, you’re a big Steely Dan fan. But does your library have ‘Everyone’s Gone to the Movies (Demo Version)’?</p>
<p>And he stares down at his fancy Italian leather shoes and you can see his face turn the slightest shade of <em>primavera</em> red, and being the kinda guy who doesn’t want to embarrass friends and waiters, I said, “Hey Nineteen, don’t feel Deacon blue.” Two quick song title references helped lighten the mood up a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2017/10/13/steely-dan-walter-becker-peg-aja-670103.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peg</a>. “I can show you how you can complete your collection in like 60 seconds.”</p>
<p>Hector’s all like, “You’re on.” (But he says it with an Italian accent, because you know, this is a really nice Italian restaurant where everyone speaks with an Italian accent). He continues, “I’ve Plexed my van. It’s out back.”</p>
<p>I say “Oh, you mean like <em>now</em>, now?”</p>
<p>“Yup. I’ve got 60 seconds before table 12 gets their <em>spumoni</em>.” And then he drops his voice a whole 12 tone octave, and says in a gravelly Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Western sort of way: “Or is your whole ‘Plex is the greatest ultra-hi-fidelity music augmentation experience the world has ever known’ claim just a bunch of marketing bunk?”</p>
<h3>A mid-meal wager is placed</h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it was on. And that’s how approximately 22 seconds later, I found myself in Hector’s van betwixt my <em>primo</em> and <em>secondo</em>. I told my dining companion to pick out a nice victory red from the wine list whilst I was away. That’s how real this just got.</p>
<h3>Yes, I got into the van</h3>
<p>Now, don’t worry &#8211; this van was one of those strangely nice Sprinter style vans that had been retrofitted into a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vanlife/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#vanlife</a> sort of vibe that you see popping up on the Instagrams of ultra-hip and attractive people who are also seemingly deeply under-employed. Rest assured, Hector had a halfway decent wifi connection, as well as a rather <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stupid-ipad-accessories-2012-5#a-maxi-pad-for-your-ipad-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impressively decorated</a> iPad Air.</p>
<p>So, just to be clear, despite the preceding set up, it was <strong>not</strong> weird. Or at least, not <em>that</em> weird. Now, did Hector have a few pet reptiles in his van? Maybe yes. But putting Hector in jeopardy with <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/64/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Customs</a> for the unlicensed importation of exotic reptiles is not the point of this post. It’s the transformation of Hector’s Plex music library (and by extension his entire way of life) in a scant 60 seconds – <em>that’s</em> the point of this post. So let’s stop obsessing about the little purple chameleons, okay?</p>
<p>Pulling out a suspiciously placed old-timey stop watch from his trouser pocket, Hector nodded to me, and said, “Do your thing, magic man.” Now to be clear, that’s not my <em>actual</em> name, but given that I was on the clock, I didn’t want to waste time clarifying my bona fides. We had a library to augment and a mind to blow, after all.</p>
<h3>Enter an ocean of music</h3>
<p>So, first thing we did after Hector started his big nickel-plated <a href="https://newatlas.com/birthday-200th-stopwatch/43431/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stop watch</a> (that looked exactly like the one from <em>60 MINUTES</em> that you see before Andy Rooney starts to rant about how he can never find a stapler when he’s in the bathroom) was to launch the Plex app on his iPad.</p>
<p>Cool, we’re just 4 seconds in and already halfway there. Then I said, “Okay, show me The Dan.” And he navigated to his Steely Dan collection for me, and if I could just give Hector some props, it was an IMPRESSIVE display of custom album art. He was truly a master curator. Okay, enough with the praise, I got a <em>secondo</em> to start.</p>
<p>His Steely Dan library prior to massive Plex augmentation looked like this:</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11674 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1024x768.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-300x225.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-768x576.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1800x1350.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1440x1080.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-800x600.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-640x480.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-400x300.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-150x113.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag.png 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>And then while he was talking about that one time he <em>almost</em> met Shag at a gallery in Silver Lake, I told Hector to go to <a href="https://www.plex.tv/music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plex.tv/music</a> and click on the <strong>Get 30 Days Free</strong> button to activate his TIDAL x Plex trial. He shot me a classic left eyebrow arch and asked the timeless question: “Bro, you sure?”</p>
<p>And I said to him, “<em>Absolument, mon frère.</em>” Which isn’t Italian because I took French in high school, but he got the gist anyway. “First month is free, so if it doesn’t turn you on, you can always turn it off. No harm, no foul.”</p>
<h3>Hungry for a FLAC attack</h3>
<p>So, on the Plex <a href="https://www.plex.tv/music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, Hector chose the HiFi edition for his free trial, which delivers something like sixty million tracks in FLAC format, plus 250,000 music videos.</p>
<p>I smiled: “Check out your new Dan, man.”</p>
<p>And lo and behold gentle reader, when his Steely Dan page refreshed (remind you, we’re only at 18 seconds into this 60 second challenge), he saw this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11663" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steely-dan-add-to-library.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hector gave me a look that said, “Oh my ever-loving god, what black magic is this?” I shot him back a look that implied, “Oh, I guess you just completed your collection with a single click.”</p>
<h3>I casually Venn-diagrammed the concept of awesomeness</h3>
<p>And now we’re at 24 seconds, so I decided to do a little showboating. “Scroll past the TIDAL ALBUMS and you’ll see PLEX RECOMMENDATIONS ON TIDAL.” Hector pondered the list. “Wait. That’s not Steely Dan. Who are these guys? ”</p>
<p>By way of response, I held onto his shoulder, stuck my arm in front of both of us, and did that majestic hand-sweeping-thing in front of his face like Howard Hughes introducing the Spruce Goose: “These are all the artists who <em>sound</em> like Steely Dan but&#8230;” and this <em>but</em> was so significant i had to say it twice, “&#8230; but <em>you</em> don’t have in <em>your</em> library. Yet.” I enunciated the final word in my best movie trailer voice. We both shivered. But it could have been his wicked powerful sub-arctic AC he modded his van with.</p>
<p>Seriously, is he transporting organs in this thing?</p>
<h3>Discover musical discovery with our nifty discovering tools</h3>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11664 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1024x973.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1024x973.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-300x285.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-768x730.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1800x1711.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1440x1369.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-800x761.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-640x608.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-400x380.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-150x143.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation.png 2026w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>And then at 35 seconds into this process of meta-musical transcendence (it was Easter Sunday after all), I said, “Go ahead and click on Discovery Radio button. This is the music that is guaranteed <em>not</em> to be in your library, but similar to the songs that <em>are</em> already in your library. It’s like discovering a parallel universe of music that you already love.”</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11667 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1024x717.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1024x717.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1800x1261.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1440x1008.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-800x560.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-640x448.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-400x280.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-150x105.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations.jpg 2022w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>He whispered to me like we’ve finally laid eyes on a golden Idol hidden in the far reaches of a spider-infested cave, “So I can get my Dan on <em>without</em> listening to Steely Dan?” And I do that classic move where I create a Venn diagram out of a handy set of tropical mango-scented Sharpies. “Think of Discovery Radio as your favorite band’s favorite tracks – that you’ve never heard of.”</p>
<p>“My favorite’s favorites…” muttered Hector. And I chuckled knowingly to myself: Hombre, we haven’t even begun to explore the cosmos of augmentation possibilities.</p>
<h3>Can an augmented music library actually win back your ex-girlfriend? We report, you decide</h3>
<p>I continued to take him down the rabbit hole with me. “Now get ready for some brand new features we’re launching this week on Android mobile &amp; TV, Apple TV, iPhone and iPad, according to <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/add-tidal-content-to-your-plex-music-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the details on our support site</a>.” In a burst of anticipation, Hector raised his eyebrows like two fuzzy caterpillars, which immediately caught the attention of his little chameleon friends. It was cute and weird all at the same time &#8211; such is #vanlife I suppose.</p>
<p>I continued, “Go to an artist that you’ve only added one album from, probably because your ex-girlfriend’s boyfriend says he was kinda into them that one time you ran into the two love-birds at the <a href="https://www.travelchannel.com/interests/shopping/articles/worlds-best-flea-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flea Market</a> and you just wanted to see what kinda stuff this new guy was made of.”</p>
<p>And Hector said with grim determination, “Yeah. That’d be The Mars Volta.”</p>
<p>I thought to myself, man you are <em>never</em> winning your ex-girlfriend back from a guy with strong music taste like that, but I kept this insight to myself because that’s not <em>my</em> journey in life, nor my quest in the back of this van. To reiterate: my singular goal is to expand minds and augment libraries. And so that’s what I did.</p>
<p>“Cool. <em>Now</em> look up that Mars Volta in your new augmented Plex, and <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Get_Schwifty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show me what you got</a>.” And Hector did so and grinned like he’s just made a hole-in-one in the golf course of life. “Instantly add a few of those deep cuts to your library and blast them outside your ex-girlfriend&#8217;s house sometime.” And he looked at me and said “Add them?” And I was all like, “Yep. You can now <em>add</em> albums from TIDAL right to your native Plex library.”</p>
<h3>And now all eyes turn to thee, Artist TV</h3>
<p>And before he could even process that wizardry, I one-upped myself by hitting him with yet another crazy super-power we’re launching this week. “So you know how you got your Artist Radio? Well <em>now</em> you got Artist TV too on Android mobile &amp; TV, Apple TV, iOS devices.”</p>
<p>He was like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4dZCUtq-yI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>what the freak</em></a>? And even though we only had 12 seconds remaining, I said, “Yep, turn it on and crank it up!” And then boom, he had Steely Dan TV, right there in his van. It’s like <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/most-memorable-moments-from-total-request-live/brandon-michaels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Total Request Live</a> from the old days, but instead of being in Times Square with the dangerously low energy Carson Daly, it’s now in the palm of your hand. Or on the wall of your home. Or on the front of your, uh, tablet. Anyway, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/apps-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you get the picture</a>.</p>
<p>You could say Hector’s jaw dropped. Because it did. Which is why you can say that. Because this post, my friends, is 100% fact-based journalism. The features by which Hector’s Steely Dan-loving mind were blown are available to you as well. Just try it out. And might I repeat our mantra? If it doesn’t turn you on, you can always turn it off.</p>

<h3>About that victory glass of red wine…</h3>
<p>So as I slid back into the restaurant booth, our Branzino arrived (bone-in because it’s that kinda joint) and I smiled at my dining companion. If only she knew the magical worlds Hector and I had just spelunked through in the van.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not an April Fool’s story, nor is it a tale powered by 420, nor even is it a special top secret <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-technology-do-you-think-the-US-government-is-currently-hiding-from-the-public-and-what-are-examples-of-previously-classified-technologies-that-were-later-declassified-and-sold-in-civilian-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">government weapons-grade robotic augmentation project</a> that your mighty tax dollars are funding. Nope. It’s just the same awesome Plex you use and love every month of the year. And now especially in April.</p>

Well, it&#8217;s almost here again. That day when our nation&#8217;s finest technical minds are focused, laser-like, on fake product announcements and promo videos to match. It&#8217;s not as if we haven&#8217;t been guilty in the past. Some may remember <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/happy-april-fools-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Rickroll of 2013</a>. Clearly one of our finest moments.</p>
<p>But 2019 is all about empowering our loyal friends. Our tireless server admins. The ones who toil day after day on behalf of their own loving friends and family. Ask yourselves: isn&#8217;t it time you give the Gift of Rick?</p>
<p>Since we want folks to be able to get things set up and in place before the 1st, we are letting you know about this today. If you have an active Plex Pass subscription, all you need to do is grab the latest <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass Server beta release</a> and check the &#8220;April Fools 2019&#8221; setting under <em>Settings &gt; Extras</em> (if you already installed the beta release and don’t see the setting, try restarting your server) and we&#8217;ll take care of the rest. On April 1st your shared users will get a very special Rickroll before the first movie they play that day; it has an emoji heart and everything!<br />

I know it’s been a while since we’ve blogged, but on a more serious note (and not wanting to give too much away) April is going to be massive for us on several platforms. Stay tuned. There are seriously awesome things to come.</p>
<p>&#8230; and good luck getting that song out of your head! Rick and Roll!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It will come as no surprise to any long-time reader of this humble publication that we here at Plex are pretty sweet on media. While you might think of us as being focused on media inside your home, we’ve always had an interest in media streaming from that fabulous assortment of cloudy pipes we call the Internet. </p>
<p>The first phase of this interest was Plex Plugins. Although fun to write, they never supported much of the rich library functionality we’ve added over the years, and they also required you to run a server. This notion of needing to run a server at home to access media from the Internet just doesn’t make a lot of sense, which is one of the reasons <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/subtitles-and-sunsets-big-improvements-little-housekeeping/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">we’re retiring them</a>.</p>
<p>The second phase came with <a href="https://www.plex.tv/news-podcasts/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plex News</a> and our recent launch of <a href="https://www.plex.tv/news-podcasts/podcasts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plex Podcasts</a>. We developed a powerful and flexible platform for delivering online media using an API nearly identical to the media server, which is awesome for a few reasons—it&#8217;s a small step (not a giant leap) for apps that are used to talking to Media Servers to support Podcasts and more, and we’ve achieved near-feature parity between online content libraries and their homebound kindred spirits. Podcasts and Plex are a great combination: an enormous trove of incredibly awesome content (OK, and some questionable content) mated with our rich media platform on just about any screen (or speaker) you’d care to use.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce the third phase of our master plan for galactic domination: Web Shows (in beta). In a nutshell, we’ve partnered with a number of media producers to bring you high-quality episodic video content inside Plex! We’ve seeded our catalog with lovely, curated shows from only the highest quality creators; no robotic “top ten life hacks” or sparkly slime spam, and we’re looking forward to growing our catalog with your help. We have the best shows from amazing publishers like Condé Nast, Bonnier Corp., Fandor, Future, TWiT, Jukin, and Studio 71, including shows from Saveur, GQ, Field and Stream, PC Gamer, and Engadget and many more to come.</p>
<p>We’ve always worked to bring you a beautiful, distraction-free experience for your media. Gorgeous interfaces for presenting media in the loveliest way, a marked lack of crazy comment threads, and abundant options for personalization. And now you can enjoy all that is Plex with a bunch of great new content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! This blog post is dedicated to you, the devoted user. The one who’s been with us since early days, meticulously curating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few terabytes</a> of media goodness. The one who would be happy to see us focus on stability and core functionality, and do a bit of house cleaning along the way.</p>
<p>For years now (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/rob-lowe-literally-ama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">li-ter-ah-ly</a>) you’ve have been asking for a way to get <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/subtitle-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtitles</a> without having to go back to the computer, submit to dubious popup ads, move the subs into place, refresh the media, get distracted by a half-eaten hoagie in the fridge. Sorry, where was I? Oh right, so we’re pleased to announce a feature which makes it so easy to find and enable a subtitle, <em>you don’t even have to leave the couch</em>. We use all sorts of smarts to find you the best matches in all sorts of languages (half of all Plexians are outside the US). <strong>This feature will be rolling out as Plex Pass Preview over the next few days</strong> as we fine tune it on Web Desktop, Xbox One, most LG TVs, Plex Media Player, Android mobile, and Android TV (iOS and Apple TV will follow up shortly).</p>

<em>Android TV</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plex has been around for the better part of a decade, and software has a way of behaving like your garage: You had every intention of keeping it neat and organized, but every nook is somehow filled with Star Wars figurines and Amiibos. So it’s critical to hold the occasional yard sale and get rid of all the accumulated cruft. It’s not an uncommon thing for a software company to do—Apple does it (et tu, OpenGL?), and so does Google (RIP Inbox, Reader).</p>
<p>The Plex ecosystem is quite large, and over the years, we’ve sometimes added things that might have made sense at the time, but didn’t age well. We’ve also been <em>incredibly</em> reluctant to take anything away from people who may be using a given feature. Or kill support for a platform with low usage or other challenges. And while any given case might not be significant, they can add up over a decade to a death by a thousand (paper) cuts. So we set out to do some house-cleaning&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn’t approach the process lightly; we looked over usage numbers and took into account maintenance costs and general customer satisfaction. In some cases, we have plans for a future in which a better replacement shows up. Other things, we’re just stabbing in the chest repeatedly with a wooden stake (and hoping it’s not a zombie). But the philosophy is the same—<em>we want to focus our finite energy on providing awesome functionality that works great and makes the folks who use it happy</em>. Without further ado, here’s the list of things we’re retiring:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Plugins</strong>: This was not a decision taken lightly, as they’ve been around for a long time, and we’ve had good times both writing and using them. But bluntly, hardly anyone uses them (less than 2% of users), the ancient protocol they use is a continued pain for clients to support, and if we were to build the feature again, we’d do it very differently in this day and age. For utility-type functionality, we love standalone apps like <a href="https://tautulli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tautulli</a> and believe this is a better approach. But don’t panic—while the Plugin Directory will soon be gone, you can still manually install plugins for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Watch Later</strong>: There’s a small handful of you who still care about this feature – just enough to form a close-knit support group – and we’re super sorry (really) if this disrupts your daily bookmarking, but the feature is costly for us to maintain, and hard to justify in the long run.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: There is very low usage, and it’s also built atop an antediluvian sync engine, so if you rely on Cloud Sync for your day-to-day, things aren’t pretty. DM us a photo of your Cloud Sync library and today’s newspaper and we’ll buy you a beer? (no, not really).</p>
<p>Lastly, as we’ve previously announced, we’re shuttering our hosted Plex Media Server in the cloud (Plex Cloud) as of November 30. For those of you who relied on the service, please accept our heartfelt apology.</p>
<p>So with all that house-cleaning out of the way, what else have we been doing with our newfound laser focus (and laser-equipped sharks? shh… that’s Phase Two)? A lot of good stuff, actually.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Making Sync Great <del datetime="2018-09-25T15:08:31+00:00">Again</del></strong>: We realize that over the years, our vaunted (and premium) offline sync feature hasn’t always worked as reliably as we would have hoped. We decided to form a Seal Team 6 style group tasked with assassinating as many sync bugs as they could, working with client and server groups, as well as with forum users. The team has already made great headway on fixing some of the most annoying bugs, and you’ll begin to see the fruits of their labor across the next wave of updates.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Making Players Play</strong>: We’ve convened a similar squadron of sauron-eyed swashbucklers to kill bugs in the new Android player engine. Yes, it’s awesome that it Direct Plays everything under the sun, but that doesn’t matter if it randomly stops playing Bachelor in Paradise right as Jenna is about to punch Jordan in the face. Also: that show is everything that is wrong about humans.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>The Sound of Music</strong>: Oh, and clamp down hard on your tuks, because we have some amazing music player improvements in the works. I don’t want to give too much away, but if it rhymes with schmapless, it may be coming to a platform near you. :mic-drop:</p>
<p>In conclusion, we’re working hard to improve our focus, spend time on things that matter the most, remove as many distractions as possible, improve stability of the core product, and launch more kick-ass features. Thanks for your feedback!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re a blog-reading Plex user (and we have a feeling you are <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), there&#8217;s a pretty good chance you care a lot about personalizing your media collection. Maybe you&#8217;ve searched tirelessly for <a href="http://hiconsumption.com/2012/11/star-wars-trilogy-minimalist-posters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalist hipster posters</a> for each of your Star Wars movies or painstakingly created music playlists for each of your many moods. Plex has always given you the ability to customize your library, but today we&#8217;re rolling out an update for iOS and Android that gives you even more control over your overall experience.</p>
<p>The philosophy behind this redesign focuses on a reimagining of the way the Plex apps are structured. It elevates some important decisions (“what do I want to watch or listen to?”) and deemphasizes some less important ones (“where is it coming from?”). There are three core aspects to the redesign:</p>
<p><strong>Customizable Home Screen:</strong> You <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-the-apps/">now have complete control</a> over the home screen of the app: you can reorder (or remove) any of the sections (like “Recently Added” or “On Deck”) or add new ones from anywhere else in the app, even across different servers (mix and match!).</p>

<p><strong>Easier Top-level Navigation:</strong> We’ve added tabs at the bottom of the screen to <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/navigating-the-apps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quickly navigate between</a> media types (Movies, TV, etc.), and those are fully customizable as well. Do you always watch movies on your tablet and listen to music on your phone? Arrange the tabs accordingly. Don&#8217;t care at all about photos in Plex? First of all, you&#8217;re a monster, but hey, now you can turn &#8217;em off and focus on the media you prefer.</p>

<p><strong>Effortlessly Cross Server Boundaries:</strong> The default source for each of the media types can be customized as well. Have content split across multiple servers? Rely on your friend’s hipster music? Or maybe you’re a huge fan of podcasts, but don’t have a &#8212; wait what? Oh yeah… that brings me to our next big announcement…</p>

<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/plex-podcasts-web-app-home-1-800x576.png" alt="" class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-10186 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/plex-podcasts-web-app-home-1-800x576.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/plex-podcasts-web-app-home-1-300x216.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/plex-podcasts-web-app-home-1-768x553.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/plex-podcasts-web-app-home-1-1024x737.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/plex-podcasts-web-app-home-1-1800x1296.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/plex-podcasts-web-app-home-1-1440x1037.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/plex-podcasts-web-app-home-1-640x461.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/plex-podcasts-web-app-home-1-400x288.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/plex-podcasts-web-app-home-1-150x108.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>So, you’ve been curating your own little Marvel Cinematic Universe and decking your Breaking Bad collection with care. You’ve got the soundtracks, the artwork, and the extras to match. You know what you need? 150 hours of Vince Gilligan creator-splaining Walter White’s motivation. This is where podcasts really shine. No rules, just words.</p>
<p>Here at Plex we like to use every part of the media and hate it when good content goes to waste. That’s why we’re adding support for the incredibly rich and diverse body of content that is Podcasts. We love the scrappy, two-people-and-a-mic nature of this ecosystem. It’s egalitarian, fanatical, and sometimes just a little bit rough-around-the-edges, but we think it’s a perfect complement to the rest of your Plex diet.</p>
<p>Podcasts are also a great fit for the media platform we’ve built here at Plex, which is probably why people have asked us to add them for years. Features like On Deck, synced view state, rich metadata, and our incredibly diverse range of platforms means that you can enjoy podcasts like never before.</p>

<p>We’re excited to be launching Podcasts in beta inside Plex today on iOS, Android, Roku, and Plex Web, (more to come, of course!) and we’d like to highlight a <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/podcasts-overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">few of the features available</a>. Best of all, podcasts are free for all users and don&#8217;t even require a Plex Media Server to be set up.</p>
<p><strong>Rich Search and Discovery:</strong> It’s easy to search for a specific podcast if you know what you’re looking for, or browse by genre, or see what’s popular. Once you start listening and building your library, our machine learning team has built a sophisticated system which delivers personalized recommendations for new podcasts.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Podcasts:</strong> Once you’ve found podcasts you enjoy (and we’re sure you will!) you can add them to ‘My Podcasts’ and your home screen. Once there, they’ll act much like a show in your personal TV libraries, with features like On Deck to make podcast bingeing just as easy as that little addiction to Ice Road Truckers you have, Ben.</p>

<p><strong>Enhanced Player:</strong> In order to give you the best possible listening experience, we’ve upgraded the players inside our mobile apps and the web app to allow for variable speed playback, as well as quickly skipping backwards or forwards.</p>

<p>It’s especially nice to use podcasts inside Plex with our newly customizable home screen. In the car, clearly you should be keeping your eyes on the road, so you can build a home screen with Recently Added music, On Deck for podcasts, and whatever other audio content you feel like!</p>

<p>We’re launching in beta so you can start playing (literally!) with Podcasts inside Plex, but we have more great features coming soon, including OPML importing, and offline podcast support for our mobile apps. You can find out more about Podcasts in Plex on our support site.</p>
<p><em>Podcasts are rolling out slowly to all supported platforms. Should be available by midday EDT to everyone.</em></p>
<p>You would think Barkley’s favorite podcast would be canine-oriented, but he actually loves listening to the mellifluous tones of <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Terry Gross</a>. It lulls him to sleep within minutes&#8230;</p>
