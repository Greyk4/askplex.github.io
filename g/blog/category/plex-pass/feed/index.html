										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We started Plex Labs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-labs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">just over two years ago</a> to provide, among other things, a playground for new apps (both our own, as well as 3rd-party apps that struck our fancy) that build on our awesome media platform. Plex can be like a fractal—everyone has their own view of what the most important parts of the platform are, and you can zoom into any one of these and spend a lifetime working on perfecting and improving that little area. In other words, a thousand zen gardens&#8230;</p>
<h3>A Brand New Plexamp</h3>
<h4>“The only kind of writing is rewriting” – Ernest Hemingway</h4>
<p>When we first launched Plex Labs, our first release was Plexamp, a tiny, highly opinionated desktop music player. But after a year of updates, things went quiet. Had we abandoned it? Was the llama tired of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-slogan-of-Winamp-whip-the-llamas-ass-mean-for-you">being whipped</a>? Had the zen garden suddenly filled with weeds? Nope. Inspired by the promise of the first releases, and our shared love with Hemingway of a <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/hemingway-daiquiri-recipe-760527">great daiquiri</a>, we decided to <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">rewrite the whole thing from scratch</a>, add a ton of features, and then release it (today? Sure why not!) on five platforms: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
<h4>One hundred and ten is the magic number</h4>
<p>We’re calling the new version 3.0 (although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x">3.11</a> might have been more appropriate) and there are so many new features that we’ve written an entire <a href="https://medium.com/plexlabs/plexamp-v3-9af3b10063b4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medium post</a> about them. If you already use music on Plex, you’re going to love it. And if you don’t, maybe it’s time to give it a try?</p>
<p>Over the last year, our small group of fearless testers has gone through 110 (that’s <em>one-hundred-and-ten</em>) betas, and it might be easiest to let their words speak for themselves:</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; font-style: italic; margin-top: -40px !important; text-align: center; color: #868c96;">To our eyes, it doesn’t suck.</p>
<p>The new version of Plexamp is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/purchase?plan=monthly&#038;utm_source=Plex&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_content=pp_plexamp_inline&#038;utm_campaign=Plex+Labs+April+15+2020+nonPP" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass</a> only. And if you need further incentive to go ahead and grab that glorious Plex Pass, Plexamp isn’t the only app we’re launching today&#8230;</p>
<h3>Introducing Plex Dash</h3>
<h4>A dash of power</h4>
<p>As you might imagine, plenty of us here at Plex run our own personal media servers and like keeping a close eye on them. So why not a single-purpose app dedicated to server administration? Like many things in the history of Plex, the genesis of Plex Dash involved scratching some itches. First of all, we wanted a beautiful way to see all playbacks, even across multiple servers; something you might repurpose an old iPad for, duct taping it to a wall in your secret lair. Something to gaze at while you stroke your hairless cat. You know the drill.</p>
<p>Secondly, we wanted a fun way for you to help edit your artwork and make your library even lovelier during any spare moment: one-handed while wrangling the kids, or in a few minutes of downtime between video calls. And last, but not least, we wanted raw administrative power: scan for new media, fix incorrect matches, check on server resource usage, tweak library settings, even view server logs live.</p>
<p>Plex Dash is built on top of the same codebase as Plexamp – check out  this <a href="https://medium.com/plexlabs/plex-dash-c42d1f624877" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medium post</a> for more details about its many features. Plex Dash is available for all <a href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/purchase?plan=monthly&#038;utm_source=Plex&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_content=pp_plex_dash_inline&#038;utm_campaign=Plex+Labs+April+15+2020+nonPP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plex Pass</a> holders today, on iOS and Android.</p>

<h3>Apps for days</h3>
<p>So we’re super excited to share these two Plex Lab apps. Because they’re lab-born, we’ll continue to tinker with them, and you should keep in mind that they are not officially supported. But if you’re excited to check them out, head to your friendly neighborhood app store (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Plex+Labs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/plex-labs/id1500797509" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a>) or our brand new <a href="https://plexamp.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plexamp.com</a> site (for the desktop apps), take them for a spin, and let us know what you think in our <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/c/testing/plex-labs">Plex Labs forum</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! This blog post is dedicated to you, the devoted user. The one who’s been with us since early days, meticulously curating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few terabytes</a> of media goodness. The one who would be happy to see us focus on stability and core functionality, and do a bit of house cleaning along the way.</p>
<p>For years now (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/rob-lowe-literally-ama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">li-ter-ah-ly</a>) you’ve have been asking for a way to get <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/subtitle-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtitles</a> without having to go back to the computer, submit to dubious popup ads, move the subs into place, refresh the media, get distracted by a half-eaten hoagie in the fridge. Sorry, where was I? Oh right, so we’re pleased to announce a feature which makes it so easy to find and enable a subtitle, <em>you don’t even have to leave the couch</em>. We use all sorts of smarts to find you the best matches in all sorts of languages (half of all Plexians are outside the US). <strong>This feature will be rolling out as Plex Pass Preview over the next few days</strong> as we fine tune it on Web Desktop, Xbox One, most LG TVs, Plex Media Player, Android mobile, and Android TV (iOS and Apple TV will follow up shortly).</p>

<em>Android TV</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plex has been around for the better part of a decade, and software has a way of behaving like your garage: You had every intention of keeping it neat and organized, but every nook is somehow filled with Star Wars figurines and Amiibos. So it’s critical to hold the occasional yard sale and get rid of all the accumulated cruft. It’s not an uncommon thing for a software company to do—Apple does it (et tu, OpenGL?), and so does Google (RIP Inbox, Reader).</p>
<p>The Plex ecosystem is quite large, and over the years, we’ve sometimes added things that might have made sense at the time, but didn’t age well. We’ve also been <em>incredibly</em> reluctant to take anything away from people who may be using a given feature. Or kill support for a platform with low usage or other challenges. And while any given case might not be significant, they can add up over a decade to a death by a thousand (paper) cuts. So we set out to do some house-cleaning&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn’t approach the process lightly; we looked over usage numbers and took into account maintenance costs and general customer satisfaction. In some cases, we have plans for a future in which a better replacement shows up. Other things, we’re just stabbing in the chest repeatedly with a wooden stake (and hoping it’s not a zombie). But the philosophy is the same—<em>we want to focus our finite energy on providing awesome functionality that works great and makes the folks who use it happy</em>. Without further ado, here’s the list of things we’re retiring:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Plugins</strong>: This was not a decision taken lightly, as they’ve been around for a long time, and we’ve had good times both writing and using them. But bluntly, hardly anyone uses them (less than 2% of users), the ancient protocol they use is a continued pain for clients to support, and if we were to build the feature again, we’d do it very differently in this day and age. For utility-type functionality, we love standalone apps like <a href="https://tautulli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tautulli</a> and believe this is a better approach. But don’t panic—while the Plugin Directory will soon be gone, you can still manually install plugins for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Watch Later</strong>: There’s a small handful of you who still care about this feature – just enough to form a close-knit support group – and we’re super sorry (really) if this disrupts your daily bookmarking, but the feature is costly for us to maintain, and hard to justify in the long run.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: There is very low usage, and it’s also built atop an antediluvian sync engine, so if you rely on Cloud Sync for your day-to-day, things aren’t pretty. DM us a photo of your Cloud Sync library and today’s newspaper and we’ll buy you a beer? (no, not really).</p>
<p>Lastly, as we’ve previously announced, we’re shuttering our hosted Plex Media Server in the cloud (Plex Cloud) as of November 30. For those of you who relied on the service, please accept our heartfelt apology.</p>
<p>So with all that house-cleaning out of the way, what else have we been doing with our newfound laser focus (and laser-equipped sharks? shh… that’s Phase Two)? A lot of good stuff, actually.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Making Sync Great <del datetime="2018-09-25T15:08:31+00:00">Again</del></strong>: We realize that over the years, our vaunted (and premium) offline sync feature hasn’t always worked as reliably as we would have hoped. We decided to form a Seal Team 6 style group tasked with assassinating as many sync bugs as they could, working with client and server groups, as well as with forum users. The team has already made great headway on fixing some of the most annoying bugs, and you’ll begin to see the fruits of their labor across the next wave of updates.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Making Players Play</strong>: We’ve convened a similar squadron of sauron-eyed swashbucklers to kill bugs in the new Android player engine. Yes, it’s awesome that it Direct Plays everything under the sun, but that doesn’t matter if it randomly stops playing Bachelor in Paradise right as Jenna is about to punch Jordan in the face. Also: that show is everything that is wrong about humans.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>The Sound of Music</strong>: Oh, and clamp down hard on your tuks, because we have some amazing music player improvements in the works. I don’t want to give too much away, but if it rhymes with schmapless, it may be coming to a platform near you. :mic-drop:</p>
<p>In conclusion, we’re working hard to improve our focus, spend time on things that matter the most, remove as many distractions as possible, improve stability of the core product, and launch more kick-ass features. Thanks for your feedback!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I wonder whether people from past generations are so fondly remembered because their minor transgressions were never properly documented. It&#8217;s difficult to stage an appropriately embarrassing photo when each exposure takes 90 seconds. So much has changed, and I can&#8217;t quite shake the suspicion that some day a new batch of humans will entertain themselves primarily by mocking our current generation’s mishaps. You spend one ill-fated Halloween rocking a Jheri curl meticulously crafted from half a bottle of your sister&#8217;s hairspray and the world will never forget. What a time to be alive&#8230;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me (that is, one part photo nerd, one part data hoarder—I mean, digital lifestyle archivist), your photo library has been growing steadily since the early days of digital. For a while this was manageable: a few pics from a vacation, a snapshot here and there. A portrait of the kids (human or canine) in an especially adorable moment. Recently though, things have gotten pretty out of hand. The iPhone in my pocket is basically better quality than almost every Hasselblad that ever existed, my Facebook friends are clamoring for anything that&#8217;s not fake news, and let&#8217;s face it, Barkley&#8217;s not getting any less adorable. It&#8217;s the perfect storm, and the ensuing torrent of photos has given my Plex Camera Upload a workout. Really, it&#8217;s my cross to bear: these sunsets and eggs benedict brunches aren&#8217;t going to document themselves, right millennials!?</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-5813 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-800x533.jpg" alt="barkley-photo-cute" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-1800x1200.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-1440x960.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>So how do we dig our way out from under this massive pile of pixels? More importantly, how do we find the proverbial needles in this hipster haystack?</p>
<p>As of today, Plex can help!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re seriously leveling up the Plex photo experience. For starters, the photos and personal video that you shoot on your phone no longer need to live in separate libraries. Your &#8220;Photo&#8221; libraries now incorporate your personal videos too. Seamless, like Ansel Adams intended. Second, we&#8217;ve significantly enhanced the photo viewer in the Web app. It&#8217;s beautiful, and it&#8217;s just a hint at shiny new things to come across the board.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-5814 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-800x479.jpg" alt="Videos now live next to your Photos" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-800x479.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-768x460.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-1536x920.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-2048x1227.jpg 2048w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-1800x1078.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-1440x863.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-640x383.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-400x240.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-150x90.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>But we weren&#8217;t merely content with a few cosmetic fixes. We’ve also sped up the process of importing photos into Plex by up to 300%. But really, we wanted to help people <em>understand</em> their photo libraries. So starting today, our Plex Pass subscribers can now let Plex automatically tag all your photos with fun stuff like &#8220;kitten&#8221; and &#8220;irish setter&#8221; using advanced machine learning technology. This is useful in a few ways:</p>
<p>First of all, you can now search for images by using tags. For example, if I type in “Puppy” in the quick search bar, I instantly get results. It’s like magic!</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-5819 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-800x487.jpg" alt="Search tagged photos" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-800x487.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-1024x623.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-768x467.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-1536x935.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-2048x1247.jpg 2048w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-1800x1096.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-1440x877.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-640x390.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-400x243.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-150x91.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Secondly, when you’re viewing a photo, you can now see related photos based on tags, and explore that related set. It’s amazingly addictive, and a great way of spelunking through years of memories.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-5816 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-800x479.jpg" alt="Related tags for Photos" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-800x479.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-768x460.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-1536x920.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-2048x1227.jpg 2048w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-1800x1079.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-1440x863.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-640x383.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-400x240.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-150x90.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Now for the fun part: I encourage you all to play a game. It&#8217;s kind of like Telephone, but the goal is to see how far you can get from where you started using only tags. My favorite was starting with &#8220;Vintage cars&#8221; and ending at &#8220;Norwegian elkhound&#8221;—how? I’ll never tell. Let us know your best photo path in the comments.</p>
<p>How do you enable this advanced-technology-which-is-clearly-indistinguishable-from-magic? <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/234976627" target="_blank">Super simple</a>: get a Plex Pass (assuming you don’t already have one), download the latest Plex Pass release of the server, and then either make a new photo library, or edit your current one to enable premium mode.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whew&#8230;it’s turning out to be a busy fall. Being October, we&#8217;ll be turning to perfecting our Halloween costumes and of course gathering wood for the coming winter, like good little hobbits and island people. To those down under, Winter is Coming&#8230;to an end.</p>
<p>Can we just take a moment to reflect on how cool it is to see the Plexverse expanding in so many exciting ways? Since we announced <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/air-human-plex-dvr-divine/">Plex DVR</a>, we&#8217;ve seen hundreds of thousands of recordings grabbed from thin air and added to Plex libraries around the world. And since we announced <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/book-plex-volume-3-plex-cloud/">Plex Cloud</a> just a week ago, we&#8217;ve seen an incredible response with people emailing, PMing, calling, and showing up at our door begging for invites (hint: it helps to bring treats for Barkley).</p>
<p>This brings us to the reason we’re here today. At the same time as we’ve been adding the massive new DVR functionality and allowing our server to run in the cloud, we’ve also been hard at work on things important to folks who run their Media Servers locally and stream remotely. We all know it’s hard to manage the limited bandwidth our miserly ISPs provide us. Sometimes, all it takes is one bad apple trying to stream a full-quality video to ruin the experience for everyone else. Well, no longer&#8230;</p>
<p>Today, we’re taking the wraps off the first few parts of an incredibly sophisticated Media Server component that helps you manage the most precious of resources: your upstream bandwidth and your CPU’s ability to transcode. This Plex Pass feature is available to our beloved premium members today in the latest Plex Pass release of the Media Server.</p>
<p>There’s so much intelligence in there that during development we started referring to it as the “Streaming Brain” and had to take some Asimov-level steps to ensure it didn’t become sentient and start passing judgment: “I’m sorry, Mike, but I’m cutting off your access to <i>Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County</i>. You’ve clearly had enough.”</p>
<p>Because internally, all things must be reduced to their emoji essence, Greg found the closest ones to streaming (shower) and brain (robot) and we started referring to the feature as simply:</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Untitled-2-800x129.png" alt="untitled" class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-5663 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Untitled-2-800x129.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Untitled-2-300x48.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Untitled-2-768x124.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Untitled-2-640x103.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Untitled-2-400x65.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Untitled-2-150x24.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Untitled-2.png 942w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Our resident illustrator, Craig, was inspired to ink something up, marketing loved it, and hey, now we’re thinking of getting t-shirts printed.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, McStreamy the Showering Robot brings two awesome new capabilities to the server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced ability for the server to communicate with players. Instead of playback just failing with a generic error, we can now give much more specific reasons. Simple change, but really nice.</li>
<li>Intelligent management of bandwidth and CPU usage to make sure that Plex never tries to exceed the limits of your Internet connection or processor. (Don’t hate on my upstream. And if you have fiber, I guarantee you that you don’t have beaches and coconuts.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Peek under the hood, and there is some <em>seriously</em> cool stuff going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced heuristics compute the best streaming parameters given available CPU and bandwidth.</li>
<li>Plex Sync and other non-time-critical transfers are treated on a best-effort basis, but will take advantage of available bandwidth when possible, scaling up and down based on usage with real-time traffic shaping.</li>
<li>Prioritization of streaming transcode sessions over non-critical work (Media Optimizer, Plex Sync, and other CPU intensive operations).</li>
<li>Bandwidth limits are performed with WAN traffic, but users with interesting network topologies can customize what constitutes remote vs. local traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to have this all work properly, the Media Server needs to do a deep analysis of your media, since the “average” bitrate reported by most files is actually pretty useless when it comes to knowing true bandwidth requirements. (Variability in media and real-time conversion are two of the hardest challenges with our platform in general.) We silently slipped this more extensive analysis into a release a while ago so it could work on your libraries ahead of release. During other scheduled maintenance tasks, it’s been hard at work figuring out exactly how much bandwidth is needed to successfully stream your media without buffering.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, congratulations, and thanks for reading! To summarize, this new feature will make streaming remotely, to multiple users, with a range of available bandwidth and CPU, much more reliable. It’s the first step of many we have planned: McStreamy will get smarter over time, and gain new capabilities. We’re fairly sure it won’t <a target="_blank" href="https://xkcd.com/534/">evolve into Skynet</span></a>, but who are we to hold it back?!</p>
<p>You can find information on how to make use of the new controls <a target="_blank" href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/227715247">on our support site</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We come bearing great news today: The <a href="https://blog.plex.tv/2015/02/24/brand-new-plex-app-platform-people/">all-new Roku app</a> and the Xbox 360 apps are graduating from their Plex Pass preview period, and are now free for everyone! That&#8217;s right, the Xbox 360 app is now available to everyone, no Plex Pass required, and the Roku app, which used to cost five buckaroos and is one of the most popular Plex apps, is now completely free, along with being like ten times as awesome. Tell your friends and family! Email your frenemies!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been working hard for months on both apps, and they are finally feature-rich enough to qualify as full Plex apps, with support for our most advanced features: Plex Home, music videos &amp; movie extras, secure connections on the Roku, Plex Mix, channels, fancy filtering and sorting, remote control, content discovery, and so much more. For those of you patiently waiting for the other big-screen apps to graduate from the preview period, this should give you a sense of the feature package we aim for.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re really grateful for all the feedback we got from our <a href="https://plex.tv/subscription/about">Plex Pass members</a> during the preview period: your suggestions helped shape the applications, your bug reports massively improved their quality, and your continued support is ever appreciated!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll leave you with some screenshots of these beautiful applications (well, and maybe a dog). We&#8217;re seriously proud of these, which we believe are among the best-looking applications that exist on their respective platforms (not that we&#8217;re biased or anything #proudparents).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it&#8217;s been a little while since we brought you the previous Most Requested Plex Feature Ever (trailers and extras), and as it turns out in the intervening months a new contender has taken the crown.</p>
<p>Luckily, we never stop working to bring you, our community of loyal Plexians, the features that matter most. Sometimes it takes a little longer than we&#8217;d like, but we&#8217;re big believers in doing things right. Like a fine wine, we&#8217;ve had this one aging in French oak barrels for over two years, and we think it&#8217;s just about ready to bottle up and ship out to our loyal Plex Passers. Grab a glass and read on.</p>
<p>Plex started over seven years ago. It’s easy for me to measure because Plex was born just three months after I got married, so basically if I forget how old Plex is I end up sleeping on the couch. It’s a comfortable couch, but not exactly on AirBnB, if you catch my drift.</p>
<p>Now seven years is a long time, and not just if you’re <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120102/">stuck in Tibet</a>. That’s enough time for a pimply-faced teenager to become the parent of his or her very own three-year-old who knows how to use Plex.</p>
<p>With all this power, however, comes great responsibility. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think my kid is ready for the old ultra-violence, how can I stop him from finding A Clockwork Orange!?&#8221; you asked. &#8220;My husband is allergic to Daleks!&#8221; you exclaimed. &#8220;Please, Plex, give me a place to stash my goat pr0n!&#8221; you bleated.  Well, whatever your reason, we realize this feature is an absolute must-have for many of you.</p>
<p>And although it&#8217;s been over two years since the insanely popular feature request was initially posted on our forums (I&#8217;m looking at you MTII), I&#8217;m happy to announce that parental controls and more are available <em>today</em> in the form of an awesome feature we like to call <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/203815766-What-is-Plex-Home-">Plex Home</a>. And now we’d like to walk you though it.</p>
<p><img title="NewImage.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NewImage.png" alt="NewImage" border="0" /></p>
<p>Plex Home is, at its core, an acknowledgement that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man_Is_an_Island">no man is an island</a>, and no woman is a peninsula. After the Great Recession, all the Millennials moved back home with their Plex installs, and now spend their waking life watching Weeds and trying to keep their little brothers out of their Anime collections. So we set out to make Plex a better place for families with fine-grained access controls by moving all the server management inside the web app, and allowing you to easily specify the exact content ratings accessible by all your friends and family.</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-19-at-11.27-PM.png" alt="" border="0" /> <img title="" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-19-at-11.28-PM.png" alt="" border="0" /> <img title="" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-19-at-10.41-PM.png" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>Now that alone that would be worthy of much rejoicing, but we really wanted to take this to the next level. We wanted to allow even <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204232573">finer-grained control</a> over sharing, and we’ve added a flexible sharing mechanism via labels which allows you to share exactly what you want. For example, you can share individual photos with your parents, or just a few Arcade Fire albums with your hipster friend who will mock you for your Coldplay collection (no, trust us, he will).</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-19-at-11.17-PM.png" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>Another really important part of being in a home with multiple family members is that creating accounts should be really easy, especially for the younger ones in your household, who may not even have an email address of their own yet. So we’ve added <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/203948776-Managed-Users">managed users</a>, which are incredibly simple to create, and don’t require a unique username, email address, or password.</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-19-at-11.31-PM.png" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>Now that you’ve created accounts for everyone from Sneezy to Drooly, we wanted to make it really easy to jump between accounts, so we added <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204232453-Fast-User-Switching">fast user switching</a>. Note that you can also set PIN protection for any user too!</p>
<p>Another thing you’ve told us is that everyone in your home should be able to use the apps which come with a Plex Pass without further ado. It was frustrating to use a separate account for a family member, only to discover that they couldn’t use the Roku app without paying for it. So we’re working on fixing that: with a Plex Pass, everyone in your Plex Home will get access to the same apps you do. We’ve already submitted an update to the Roku app, and we’re in the process of updating others.</p>
<p>That’s not all. As of today, even if you <em>don’t</em> have a Plex Pass (and really, <a href="https://plex.tv/subscription/about">why wouldn’t you</a>?), we’ve made Multiuser and Now Playing free for everyone. So now everyone you share with gets their own view history, and you can see what’s being streamed, in real time! Finer-grained sharing, multiuser Homes, and fast user switching are still limited to Plex Pass holders, so if you like what you see, pick one up today!</p>
<p>So how do you start using Plex Home today? Very simple:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://plex.tv/downloads?channel=plexpass">Download</a> the latest v0.9.11.4 Plex Media Server release (or if you’re on Windows or OS X, use our brand new auto-update mechanism inside server settings!)</li>
<li>Use one of the apps which has been updated for Plex Home support: Plex Home Theater, Roku, and of course the web app.</li>
<li>Make a Plex Home, as described in our excellent <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/sections/200641063">support section</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll be adding Plex Home support to our other apps in short order!</p>
<p>Barkley is most definitely in my Plex Home.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, we want to thank all of you for the support and loyalty you have given us over the last few years. We truly have the most amazing and passionate community of media lovers on the planet, and it makes our job an absolute joy. If you already have a Plex Pass, rejoice! To show appreciation for your loyalty, the price of your subscription is not increasing (and if you were thinking about upgrading, now is the time). If you don&#8217;t have a Plex Pass, this is your last chance to subscribe at current rates.</p>
<p>We’re working harder than ever to bring more Plex goodness to all your favorite devices, and we’re super excited about the things we’re working on and can’t wait to share them with you over the next few months! With premium features and content, sometimes come moderate cost increases. So on September 29, 2014 we’ll be making some changes to our Plex Pass subscription rates for <strong>new</strong> subscriptions (and to clarify, upgrades count as new subscriptions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly Plex Pass subscriptions will increase from $3.99 to <strong>$4.99</strong> per month.</li>
<li>Annual Plex Pass subscriptions will increase from $29.99 to <strong>$39.99</strong> per year.</li>
<li>Lifetime Plex Passes will increase from $74.99 to <strong>$149.99</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all of you Paypal subscribers, we now have support for recurring monthly and annual Paypal subscriptions. We’re also making it easy to view your billing summary by providing full transaction history and receipts.</p>
<p>Again, please note that these new rates <strong>will only affect new subscriptions</strong> moving forward. Of course, as we’ve mentioned in the past, we may need to charge separately for certain types of premium content, and we may need to adjust Plex Pass prices again in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all of your support and keep an eye out for more new exciting releases coming very soon!</p>
<p>[Edit: added some frequently asked questions]</p>
<p>Q: <strong>Sure, but are you going to bring X feature to app Y</strong>?</p>
<p>A: It’s fair to assume we’re shooting for feature parity, especially with big things like playlists and premium features like Extras.</p>
<p>Q: <strong>Why do Android Plex Pass members get the app for free, but not iOS/Windows</strong>?</p>
<p>A: We’re working on the best way to address this inconsistency.</p>
<p>Q: <strong>I need to see a roadmap to know if it’s worth it</strong>.</p>
<p>A: That’s not a question. And we don’t release roadmaps, but if we did, it would just be a giant neon sign saying AWESOME STUFF. With a really good bar serving microbrews and <a href="http://www.jeppsonsmalort.com">Malört</a> underneath the sign.</p>
<p>Q: <strong>Why is the Lifetime price going up so much compared to the others</strong>?</p>
<p>A: It’s rising disproportionately compared to the other plans because, frankly, at 2.5x the price of a yearly, it was priced in an unsustainable way for us. Turns out humans have a rather long lifespan.</p>
<p>Q: <strong>Is the subscription bound to a device or a server</strong>?</p>
<p>A: Generally speaking it’s bound to a server (or servers, if you have more than one). There’s one feature (Camera Upload) which requires a Plex Pass on the app, but we’re going to be fixing that.</p>
<p>Q: <strong>I just subscribed, do I get a refund if I upgrade</strong>?</p>
<p>A: As the great Chuck Norris once said “Anything else would be less than civilized”. And then he crushed a piece of carbon into a diamond. With his beard. When you upgrade, we issue a prorated refund or credit of the amount remaining on your current plan. For example, if you’re half-way into a monthly subscription, we’ll refund you about two bucks.</p>
<p>Q: <strong>Do I get all future features or not? What’s with the disclaimer around premium content</strong>?</p>
<p>A: The reason why we always have the disclaimer is simple. Let’s say in the future we added some sort of PNetflix-like service (silent P) where we streamed premium movies. There’s no way we could afford that based on a Plex Pass, so we’d need to make it a separate feature with additional cost. But for example, the mega-cool Extras feature we just added involved licensing premium content, and everyone with a Plex Pass got it for free. So we’re just being up front and making sure we’re not limiting ourselves in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it looks like you love having trailers in Plex! Thanks so much for all the kind words and great feedback. We’re thrilled to bring you some most excellent enhancements, less than two weeks after our <a href="https://blog.plex.tv/2014/07/31/frankly-trailer-dont-give-playlist/">original launch</a> of the feature. Let’s dive in and explore the new stuff! First of all, we’ve massively improved our algorithm for picking appropriate and related trailers when using Cinema Trailers. We now take content rating into account for both library and &#8220;new and upcoming&#8221; trailers, so your kids won&#8217;t be subjected to an R-rated trailer before The Little Mermaid, for example. You also have complete control over where your Cinema Mode trailers come from—you can even pick multiple sources!</p>
<p><img title="2014-08-11 at 7.42 PM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-11-at-7.42-PM.png" alt="2014 08 11 at 7 42 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p>Many of you also requested better localization, and we&#8217;re happy to report that &#8220;new and upcoming&#8221; trailers are now also chosen based on your library language whenever possible.</p>
<p>Next up, by popular request, you can now automatically get “red band” (restricted audiences) trailers for your R- and NC-17-rated movies when available. You can find this preference in the agent settings, and you’ll need to force refresh your library to get those trailers.</p>
<p><img title="2014-08-11 at 7.32 PM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-11-at-7.32-PM.png" alt="2014 08 11 at 7 32 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p><img title="red_band.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/red_band1.png" alt="Red band" border="0" /></p>
<p>You can also enable Cinema Trailers on a per-library basis in the library settings. Because hey, if you&#8217;re like us, you may not want Cinema Trailers before your collection of cat videos.</p>
<p><img title="2014-08-11 at 7.38 PM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-11-at-7.38-PM.png" alt="2014 08 11 at 7 38 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p>Last, but not least, we&#8217;ve added another requested feature, the ability to specify a custom “pre-roll” video to follow Cinema Trailers. You can use it to roll your favorite THX video (try not to blow out your speakers, please), a short PSA telling your family to stop texting during the movie, or that one clip of your dog catching a frisbee in his teeth. The video has to be in a Plex library, and using it is as easy as copying and pasting the URL into the pre-roll setting (an advanced setting on the Extras page).</p>
<p><img title="2014-08-11 at 8.08 PM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-11-at-8.08-PM.png" alt="2014 08 11 at 8 08 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p>The new release is available right now for <a href="http://plex.tv/subscription/about">Plex Pass</a> members from our <a href="https://plex.tv/downloads">downloads page</a>, and full release notes are available <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/62832-plex-media-server/?p=692168">here</a>. Barkley is still proud to be sporting his <a href="https://www.kotisdesign.com/estore/landing.asp?estore=plex">Plex collar</a>, which of course includes a bottle opener. Best. Invention. Ever.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I can’t even tell you how much pleasure it gives me to sit down and write this post. Why, you...</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can’t even tell you how much pleasure it gives me to sit down and write this post. Why, you might ask? Because today we’re bringing you two of the most highly requested features we’ve had, ever. If you look at the <a href="http://plex.tv/subscription/about">Plex Pass</a> <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/forum/120-feature-bug-voting/">feature voting forum</a>, you’ll see the #1 requested feature is trailers. And today, dear reader, you shall have trailers. But it doesn&#8217;t end there. It’s like Christmas in July! (That&#8217;s exceptional even in the southern hemisphere, right?)</p>
<p><img title="2014-07-29 at 10.50 PM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2014-07-29-at-10.50-PM.png" alt="2014 07 29 at 10 50 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p>Now, we here at Plex like to exceed your expectations. We really do. We all grew up raising blue-ribbon heifers and memorizing π to an ungodly number of digits, and we just really don’t believe in anything but the best. So we scoured the earth looking for the best source for trailers and we found one which also had tons of interviews and behind-the-scenes content. Talk about leveling up your library!</p>
<p><img title="2014-07-29 at 11.37 PM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2014-07-29-at-11.37-PM.png" alt="2014 07 29 at 11 37 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p>If you have a <a href="http://plex.tv/subscription/about">Plex Pass</a>, we’ll automatically add all these amazing extras to your library as you add movies (or just refresh existing ones). Otherwise, we’ll also happily read any extras you already have locally; just be sure to follow our naming guidelines <a title="here" href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200220677-Local-Media-Assets-Movies">here</a>. We’re in the process of adding extras and trailer support to all our apps. At launch, Plex Home Theater and our web app have full trailer and extras support, while Android and iOS have basic trailer support. Support in other apps will follow in short order.</p>
<p><img title="NewImage.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NewImage1.png" alt="NewImage" border="0" /></p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="2014-07-29 at 11.42 PM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2014-07-29-at-11.42-PM.png" alt="2014 07 29 at 11 42 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="2014-07-29 at 11.43 PM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2014-07-29-at-11.43-PM.png" alt="2014 07 29 at 11 43 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p>We weren’t content just bringing you extras, mind you. We wanted to create a full cinema experience right in your living room (popcorn not included), so we added a feature we call Cinema Trailers. Choose the types of trailers to use on the server; then in supported Plex apps, you can select the number of trailers to play before a movie. So sit the whole family down, dim the lights, and enjoy the coming attractions!</p>
<p><img title="2014-07-29 at 11.52 PM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2014-07-29-at-11.52-PM.png" alt="2014 07 29 at 11 52 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p>We truly hope you enjoy trailers in Plex. Note that this is the first time we’ve licensed premium content for our Plex Pass users; so, we reserve the right to impose viewing limits in the future in order to keep Barkley fed. (Not plump, just fed.) So, now onto playlists. We’ve been eager to bring you this feature for ages, as we consider it a key part of any self-respecting media system.  But we wanted to make sure we got it right, and laid the groundwork for a perfect playlist experience across all your devices.  So without further ado, we present true playlists, for the first time ever, across Plex. Oh, and One More Thing&#8230;  we’re especially excited about our iTunes importer. Many of us have been on iTunes for years, and our importer provides you with a nearly seamless way to transition over playlists (including smart playlists), play/skip counts, track ratings, and even media addition dates. I’m pretty sure you’d agree these imported playlists look incredibly sexy!</p>
<p><img title="2014-07-30 at 12.30 AM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2014-07-30-at-12.30-AM.png" alt="2014 07 30 at 12 30 AM" border="0" /></p>
