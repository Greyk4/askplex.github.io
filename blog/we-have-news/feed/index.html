Plex can be setup so many ways. Look at his comment to me. He clearly said it updated and he can&#039;t do anything about it. So as I said to him if you had all Android clients then you can roll back to previous versions at will, same as the server. It&#039;s great because you can deal with any new update that breaks x feature. Obviously this is one of the huge benefits to my setup which I did intentionally because of the issue I had with smart TVs and TiVo units in the past (which I have been told Plex fixed the cable provided TiVo issue and it works great).]]></description>

I have used the forums and had success with getting help from actuall Plex employees and from the community. Also you can downgrade to whatever version you want. I have all Android clients so downgrading the app is easy if needed and obviously I can change the server version to what ever version I want. Now if your stuck with a TiVo or smart TV that you have no control over the version then I would suggest stand alone boxes like Shield TV where you have more control. ]]></description>

... which is why integrating a customer support platform would be ideal, so that you guys actually have a mechanism in place to help facilitate and manage that pesky 2nd part (plus following-up, generating digests, distributed known solutions, etc).

Intercom, desk.com, issuetrak... there are a bunch of em. Just about ANY of them would work better than using a forum.]]></description>

It&#039;s not &#039;my setup&#039;. When something works and then only thing you change is the version and it breaks then it not &#039;my setup&#039;. I&#039;m not interested in testing new features. I just want the ones I paid for to work.
Of course it would be easier to work out how to fix something  if they would actually provide support but they don&#039;t . Nothing No support at all for a product that they are selling.
No  contact from a Plex employee at all and no way to contact them.
Think about that before you send them  any money.]]></description>
