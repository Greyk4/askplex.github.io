					<description><![CDATA[I am using PLEX on my FreeNas box and it&#039;s working fine. I configured PLEX DVR and that is working fine too, I wished PLEX has a plugin to skip the commercial on the fly while recording (maybe in the future), right now I am using MCEBUDDY, it works, but MCBUDDY will pick up after recording it&#039;s done (waiting 2-3 more hours after recording is finished.
Also, what the most important is the LiveTV. I tested Live TV feature on Emby, it&#039;s working great, the best thing. The problem that I find with Emby is slowness in Library media scans, I don&#039;t know why. 
I don&#039;t know why Plex has featured yet Live TV, this will be a SlingBox killer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know this is a bit of an old post but in order to get past the live TV issue could I record a show and then about half way through stop the recording and then start recording it again which would in essence have two files?  One I can watch now while the other is still recording?]]></description>

Just make sure it&#039;s a live feed and guide to every device from just one box. PLEX should be a complete TIVO/Slingbox/Tablo/HomeRun experience/replacement on the Nvidia Shield. You all have the capability and know-how to do it and it would fit in perfectly with PLEX&#039;s features and capabilities.]]></description>

I understand what you want. However Plex does not do live tv at this time as I stated. It only works with HD Homerun at this time. I&#039;m sorry that I cannot give you a yes/no about what might happen in the future]]></description>

Emilio? I wanna be able to hook a USB OTA dongle into my Nvidia Shield to watch live TV and record. Stay with me? Meaning... I want Plex to be able to utilize the power of the Nvidia Shield to NEVER need a Tablo or HomeRun. Just plug in a USB OTA antenna dongle into my Nvidia Shield and open the PLEX app on my Shield to stream the live TV (or DVR recordings) AND have PLEX transcode INSTANTLY my MPEG-2 OTA live feeds to Roku, Apple TV, iPad, iPhone and Android devices on-the-fly using the Nvidia X1 processor. I don&#039;t wanna have to rely on anything but a Shield TV, OTA USB dongle and external hard drive. No other box needed. I want PLEX to become a software only version of Tablo/HomeRun using nothing more than a USB dongle and Nvidia Shield to stream live OTA antenna feeds across every device I own straight from the Shield akin to a Slingbox.]]></description>
