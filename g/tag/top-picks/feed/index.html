										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heist movies are ubiquitous and never go out of style because everyone can relate to that feeling of rooting for the antihero to stick it to the man — usually with a semi-automatic weapon and a crooked smile. Some of the most beloved movies are the ones where a crook pulls off the impossible.</p>
<p>A great heist movie usually comprises four things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great characters</li>
<li>An unsteal-able thing</li>
<li>An unforeseen obstacle</li>
<li>A great twist</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to explore a few films that tackle this beloved genre, and these cardinal beats, albeit from different angles, with different prizes and with varying levels of success. Three — count ‘em 3 — of these star <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/morgan-freeman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Freeman</a>, who, with seven figure paydays, just can’t seem to walk away from that last big score.</p>
<p>Okay amateur safecrackers, let’s pull on our ski masks and dive in shall we?</p>
<h3>1. The Code &#8211; a.k.a. Thick As Thieves</h3>

<blockquote>
<h3>“Some men were born to compose music, others to split the atom. I was born to steal shit.”</h3>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Code</em> opens big. A gutsy midday robbery, a near-impossible escape, and the scene is set for the partnership that would define the film. It’s an arranged marriage that doesn’t make sense right away, but doesn’t stop <em>The Code</em> from being a fun movie. There’s a place for a film where you don’t have to pay attention to every beat and can throw it on when you’re cooking dinner. The Code didn’t take home any golden statuettes, but it plays inside the heist sandbox and doesn’t take itself too seriously, so you don’t have to either.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, from almost minute one of <em>The Code</em>, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/morgan-freeman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Freeman&#8217;s</a> Ripley lays down hard lines that <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/antonio-banderas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antonio Banderas’s</a> Gaby absolutely cannot break. “If you sleep with [my adult goddaughter], I’ll tear your heart out, I mean it.” </p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16142 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/antonio-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/antonio-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/antonio-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/antonio-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/antonio-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/antonio-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/antonio-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/antonio-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/antonio.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>But the explosive sexuality of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/antonio-banderas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antonio Banderas</a> will not be caged, baby! That same night, he beds the gorgeous Russian, played by <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/radha-mitchell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radha Mitchell</a>. The next morning, he awakens to find <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/morgan-freeman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Freeman</a> standing over him in bed. A surprised Banderas is like “holy shit, weirdo! What are you doing over my bed, holding the clip for the gun I keep under my pillow?”</p>
<p>“Don’t do it again!” <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/morgan-freeman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Freeman</a> demands, but leaves Gaby’s heart untorn for the moment.</p>
<p>Faced with this new ultimatum, Gaby considers his options. The Russian, after all, had a lot of the same red flags you’d find in the <em>SNL</em> Kristen Wiig &#8216;Red Flag&#8217; sketch, most notably that when she enters a Russian dance club, she grabs the chain-wearing bouncer behind the neck and pulls him into a kiss.</p>
<p>Red flaaaaag.</p>

<p>And her idea of attire is… I don’t even know the word for it. A front scarf halter with drapery cords to hold it in place?</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16150 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/halter-top-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/halter-top-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/halter-top-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/halter-top-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/halter-top-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/halter-top-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/halter-top-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/halter-top-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/halter-top.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Not that I’m complaining! Anyone with a back that beautiful should flaunt it.</p>
<p>But will The <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/antonio-banderas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banderas</a> resist? Can he fight both the admonishment of his new partner and the devil-may-care enticement of the vanishing scarf halter?</p>
<p><em>Dios mio, no!</em> The scorching, quasar-hot sexuality of mint-condition <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/antonio-banderas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antonio Banderas</a> cannot be just arbitrarily reined in by someone’s gentle-speaking godfather! Boom!</p>
<p>Banderas.<br />
In the bedroom.<br />
<em>With the pipe.</em></p>
<p>When the Russian is then captured and used as bait to force the men into a heist, Morgan Freeman is pissed.</p>
<p>“I told you to stay away from her!”</p>
<p>“But I am slicked-back-hair <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/antonio-banderas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antonio Banderas</a>. The Banderas of legend, whose pheromones alone can impregnate a chicken from forty miles away. You can’t ask the sun not to shine, baby!” ← is what he should have said, but instead they just steal the unstealable thing.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll take the smoldering middle age hotness of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/antonio-banderas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antonio Banderas</a> in 2018’s <em>Life Itself</em> over the greased-back Antonio Banderas who didn’t have joint pain, but that’s just me. Despite its quirks and errors, I enjoyed the hell out of <em>The Code</em>, which was released in some places with the name <em>Thick As Thieves</em>.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16167 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/thick-as-thieves-poster-200x300.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/thick-as-thieves-poster-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/thick-as-thieves-poster-150x225.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/thick-as-thieves-poster.jpg 250w" data-sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>(They were not, it bears mentioning, thick as thieves.)</p>
<p><em>The Code</em> is a popcorn movie that you can poke fun at without missing a beat. The worst part about it is that young <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/tom-hardy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hardy</a> is in it in an ancillary cop role&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16168 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tom-hardy-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tom-hardy-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tom-hardy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tom-hardy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tom-hardy-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tom-hardy-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tom-hardy-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tom-hardy-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tom-hardy.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&#8230;and it kills you to know the unused talent there. He had like three lines. Ugh! Still, <em>The Code</em> is cheesy enough to be fun, and there’s enough meat on the bone and enough plot twists to keep the story chugging along.</p>

<p>For this heist movie we jump the ocean and a half century or so to London of the 1950s, where <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/demi-moore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Moore</a> plays Laura Quinn, a female manager — notably the only female manager — in the infinite old boys’ club of a respected London diamond firm.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16146 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demi-moore-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demi-moore-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demi-moore-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demi-moore-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demi-moore-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demi-moore-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demi-moore-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demi-moore-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demi-moore.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Moore’s Laura is a worker bee: the first to the office and last to leave every day. Though she’s well-liked and seemingly respected, she’s expected to work harder than anyone else just to maintain her position in a company that has passed her over for promotion six times. The costs to her personal life are notable. Merely to rise to her current position, ever so slightly below that glass ceiling, Laura has foregone marriage, family, and really love of any kind.</p>
<p>Then we meet her janitor, the unassuming Mr. Hobbs, played by <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/michael-caine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Caine</a>. Hobbs has a plan. He knows Laura is about to be fired, and offers her a way out — partner with him to steal some diamonds from the vault. Juuuuust a few. Not enough so anyone notices.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16160 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/michael-caine-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/michael-caine-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/michael-caine-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/michael-caine-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/michael-caine-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/michael-caine-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/michael-caine-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/michael-caine-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/michael-caine.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Laura’s not so sure at first, but when she is able to find her own termination papers in the desk of her manager’s secretary, she knows that her days at the firm are numbered.</p>
<p>That’s when the proverbial game is afoot! Caine’s Mr. Hobbs pulls off a jaw-dropping heist that leaves everyone, including Laura, shocked. Piecing everything back together is the fun of <em>Flawless</em>. </p>
<p>The film opens with a terribly written character, a modern reporter named Cassie played by <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/natalie-dormer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Natalie Dormer</a>, who is an amalgam of everything Olds think Youngs are. On the phone, self important, rude, and daffy. The mechanism is intended to allow Demi’s Laura, now in an old lady mask, to tell the story herself. It’s a hamfisted device that nearly pulled me out of the film, despite the best efforts of Dormer, who is always fun to watch.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16145 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cassie-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cassie-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cassie-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cassie-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cassie-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cassie-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cassie-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cassie-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cassie.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>But once you’re ported back to the past, that’s when the fun begins.</p>
<p>I feel like we’ve seen this shade of performance before from Caine, but he’s always brilliant and a credit to any movie he’s in. He’s so good that we buy <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/michael-caine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael Caine</a> as an unnoticeable doof. If you know anything about Michael Caine, you know that he grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, and so it feels effortless for him to play blue collar, despite being film royalty.  I love Michael Caine so much it’s borderline religious.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there’s no icky relationship between an old dude and a much much younger woman. Sometimes you review a film like this and you get a guy on geritol successfully wooing a college girl (or more often, chased by her) and despite being moderately uncomfortable to watch, it also can feel disingenuous and pull you out of the suspension of disbelief. I’m not saying that partners of all ages can’t find love when both parties are willing and of consenting age. In some cultures, marrying an older man is a sign of prestige. (If we were a more intelligent species, marrying an older woman would be!) I’m just saying that sometimes, it’s a malady of poor casting. And partners are wedged together to satisfy the plot even when the audience is like: that would <em>never </em>happen. <em>Flawless </em>steps daintily around the issue and has Caine and Moore as colleagues and partners, nothing more.</p>
<p><em>Flawless </em>doesn’t always hit the mark in every scene, and until the heist it’s a bit like color by numbers. But once the caper happens, it’s divertingly good fun. Especially as you watch the characters unpeeling how it all went down.</p>

<p>Going into this movie, what I had heard most about it was the contentious relationship between director <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/frank-oz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank Oz</a> and <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/marlon-brando" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marlon Brando</a> in what would be his final feature film role. Oz apparently tried to push Brando for a certain performance and the elder statesman of the celluloid blew up, making fun of Oz’s muppet roots and reportedly yelling “I bet you wish I was a puppet so you could stick your hand up my ass and make me do what you want.”</p>
<p>Oof.</p>
<p>After that blowup, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/marlon-brando" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brando</a> refused to speak to Oz for the rest of the shoot, and any communication from then on had to run through <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/robert-de-niro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert De Niro</a>.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16144 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brando-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brando-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brando-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brando-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brando-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brando-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brando-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brando-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brando.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Sounds like a hell of a set.</p>
<p>Even considering that, <em>The Score</em> is, at the very least, a competent film. Unlike a movie like <em>The Code</em>, where it feels sort of fakey-fake or movie-real, <em>The Score</em> feels like a legit heist movie. The characters seem like professional thieves. They plan appropriately. They seem appropriately wary. They are excellent at the art of acquiring the goods of others.</p>
<p><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/robert-de-niro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">De Niro</a> plays Nick, a master thief with a specialty in safecracking who is looking for one last score. <em>No, really this time</em>, he tells his girlfriend, played by the captivating <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/angela-bassett" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Angela Bassett</a>.</p>
<p>You know I love to howl at the moon about wasted talent and maybe there hasn’t been a less worthy role in cinema than the role of ‘basically useless girlfriend’ for a titan like <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/angela-bassett" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Angela Bassett</a>. I weep to imagine her reading this script, highlighting her 15 lines or so and thinking “really?” Bassett’s character could have been played by anyone, in that her only function was a plot robot to deliver an ultimatum to De Niro’s safecracking Nick: <em>quit or I’m gone.</em></p>

<p>Nick is approached by his longtime associate and table-setter, Max, played by <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/marlon-brando" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marlon Brando</a>, who says he has one big job. A game changer. The big one. But in order to do it, Nick will have to break one of his foundational rules and steal in his own city of Montreal. But Max swears it’s legit. And he has an inside guy in the government facility where they’ll steal a priceless French artifact.</p>
<p>That inside guy is Jack, played by <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/edward-norton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ed Norton</a>. If you’re an Ed Norton fan, well, you’re in for a treat because his acting chops are in full effect in this movie. His cover is playing an intellectually disabled night janitor in the most impregnable facility in Canada. By day, he’s scheming, looking for a safecracker good enough to partner with. By night, he’s waxing floors and spraying windows. If you’re not a fan of Ed Norton, his voice and mannerisms are going to feel like nails on a chalkboard in this one, but you still won’t be able to deny his skill.</p>

<p>From the beginning, Nick is like <em>hell no</em>. Too risky, too dangerous. He doesn’t trust Jack. Jack doesn’t trust him. De Niro’s Nick is somewhere on the spectrum with his character Neil McCauley from <em>Heat</em> and Jack Walsh from <em>Midnight Run</em>, which is to say that trust comes hard for the man.</p>
<p>But the effete Max is able to convince Nick to do it. One final score. That old chestnut.</p>
<p>From there, the film takes off. There are some great twists and moments of high tension but ultimately it may not be the highest praise that my most memorable takeaway from the film was “wow, Montreal is gorgeous. I want to live there.” Kind of a bummer, considering it would be the last time we’d get to see Brando on the big screen.</p>
<p>Still, this is a professional film. Seeds are planted, beats are hit. Everything is not what you think it is, which validates the mistrust between the two thieves and frames the story for a very satisfying ending.</p>

<h3>“The Lonely Maiden is marked by the subtle use of tone and mood to create a striking image of desperate longing and overwhelming passion.”</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve explored a few different brands of heist, but none that are like The Maiden Heist.</p>
<p>The story here is entirely different. Three Boston-based museum security guards, all a little sensitive, are in love with three different works of art at a museum where they work. One day they find out that the collection has been sold to a museum in Denmark, and they decide that they must do whatever it takes to save their beloved pieces from this fate. It’s a life and death thing for them, and they feel compelled to act.</p>
<p>In less evolved times, these three men might be derided and derogatorily labeled “betas” for their kind and diminutive personas. They aren’t aggressive. They’re sort of afraid of their own shadows. Frankly, I found it refreshing to watch a heist film without all that typical male braggadocio.</p>

<p>Together they form an unlikely team, unified in the mission of, well… preventing others from having the art they’re obsessed with.</p>
<p>It’s a delightful film that unfortunately seems to have had a very unsatisfactory life. This is why it’s so hard to make the 20 million dollar art film these days, and when you Google it, <em>The Maiden Heist</em> reads like a cautionary tale. Plagued with money issues, the film feels like it runs out of cash at the end. Word on the street is that they put all the money they had into production, leaving it with no marketing budget and no potential partners to distribute the film, which was compounded by the fact that the production company that bankrolled it went bankrupt. I don’t think this little film ever had even a limited domestic release, which is a damn shame.</p>

<p>This is not the testosterone firestorm that many heist flicks aim to be. This is a smaller movie, more intimate and thoughtful. If only it had a good punch up writer to take the air out of some of the jokes, they really could have had something here. Ultimately, this is a movie you can watch with your grandparents or your kids (if you don’t mind them seeing <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/william-h-macy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William H. Macy’s</a> naked derriere). For those of us who long for the return of the mid-level arthouse film, this is at least a small gem that can tide us over.</p>

<p>For those of you not familiar with <em>The Saint</em>, it’s the story of an orphan with what appears to be undiagnosed oppositional defiant disorder, who is mistreated by the monks in the orphanage where he’s raised. Stripping the orphans of their given monikers, the clergy rename all the children after famous saints.</p>
<p>But the young Templar isn’t so keen on the bullshit name the monks give him, and instead names himself after Simon, a magician, and Templar, from the sect of famous knights. He then grows up to become a dude who can rock any disguise from a crazy-ass stache to a bald-cap to a Yanni wig. Some of his teeth prosthetics are naaaasty. He can do, in seconds, the kind of quick change appearance alteration that takes modern makeup departments hours to accomplish.</p>

<p>And for every new ‘character’ he takes the name of a different saint, which informs his performance and his goal with that particular persona.</p>
<p><em>The Saint</em> felt much more fun to me in my 20s than it did this time. Maybe it’s because a primary expositional tool of the script is Templar talking aloud to himself. Maybe it’s because I loved <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/roger-moore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Moore</a> as <em>The Saint</em> and I only like <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/val-kilmer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Val Kilmer</a> as <em>The Saint</em>. Why didn’t someone as talented and impressive as Val Kilmer ever become <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/tom-cruise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Cruise</a>? I can’t remember a performance before <em>The Saint</em> that I didn’t 100% love Val Kilmer in. Look at this list! This is all prior to 1997:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nick Rivers in <em>Top Secret!</em></li>
<li>Chris Knight in <em>Real Genius</em></li>
<li>Iceman in <em>Top Gun</em></li>
<li>Madmartigan in <em>Willow</em></li>
<li>Jim Morrison in <em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/movie/the-doors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Doors</a></em></li>
<li>Uncredited Elvis in <em>True Romance</em></li>
<li>Doc Holliday in <em>Tombstone</em></li>
<li>Batman in <em>Batman Forever</em></li>
<li>Chris Shiherlis in <em>Heat</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, holy shit. That’s a <em>run</em>, man. Damn! He was Batman, and not even the Batman that everyone hates! (Looking at you, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/george-clooney" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">George Clooney</a>.)</p>
<p>These are the roles that led up to Val being cast as Simon Templar in <em>The Saint</em>. And I didn’t even mention <em>Thunderheart</em>.</p>
<p>And then… what happened? His career changed a bit after <em>The Saint</em>. He was always dogged by the whisper around town that he was a challenge to deal with. By his own admission he was a jerk to Tom Cruise on the <em>Top Gun</em> set. Maybe after <em>The Island of Dr. Moreau</em> and <em>The Saint</em> he got a rep that he couldn’t open a picture anymore, and maybe producers just didn’t want the hassle. He didn’t really feel like vintage Val Kilmer again until <em>Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang</em> in 2005.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16169 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/val-the-saint-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/val-the-saint-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/val-the-saint-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/val-the-saint-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/val-the-saint-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/val-the-saint-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/val-the-saint-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/val-the-saint-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/val-the-saint.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>That said, <em>The Saint</em> is still fun. Kilmer, while tonally feeling a wee bit off as a heartless seducer, is still pure talent. And <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/elisabeth-shue">Elisabeth Shue</a>? What is it about Elisabeth Shue? I love her in everything, going back to <em>Adventures in Babysitting</em>. I’m not sure her performance in <em>The Saint</em> is anything to write home about, but it&#8217;s still somehow very magnetic. I feel about her the way <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/christopher-walken">Christopher Walken</a> feels about the Maiden painting in <em>The Maiden Heist</em>: she somehow just <em>glows</em>.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16148 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-the-saint-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-the-saint-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-the-saint-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-the-saint-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-the-saint-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-the-saint-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-the-saint-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-the-saint-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elisabeth-the-saint.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Choices are made in <em>The Saint</em> that don’t quiiiiiite work, and even though it’s fun, it leaves you with the feeling of what might have been. How is it that Bond has 26 films and Simon Templar only has one? Maybe it’s the gadgets. Maybe the technophilial, contact tracing, facial-recognition world of today isn’t the ideal playground for a master of disguise. But oh, if it could be! Who might be the Simon Templar of today if we were to crack that egg again?</p>

<p>But it doesn’t matter. <em>Hard Rain</em> is an absolute disaster. I think I was poking fun at the movie within like the first three minutes. I can’t remember watching a less believable film. My better half was working on her laptop on the sofa next to me and even she was hurling shade at it, which is a rare event. When movies go off the rails, they go hard, and <em>Hard Rain</em> is, in a word, <em>turrible</em>.</p>
<p>The premise is that a team of bad guys, run by Freeman, is going to knock over an armored truck. But there’s a flood warning on, a biblical flood, by the way, and the town has been evacuated. An armored car has been dispatched to clean out the banks in the flood zone because, y’know, you can’t use money if it gets wet. Duh. Everyone knows that. (Ostensibly, the conceit is that the banks will be in a lawless land where looters could try to pierce the vaults and acquire the greenbacks, but can they do that in this kind of weather?)</p>
<p>And that’s pretty much the idea. The armored truck gets stuck in a big ass puddle, can’t move, and the hyenas swoop in. Boy scout Christian Slater hides the money from Morgan Freeman and then it’s a game of capture the flag as Freeman hunts Slater and some local cops jump in to restore order.</p>

<p><em>Hard Rain</em> will go down in history as an ambitious attempt that just couldn’t deliver. I’m sorry to say it, but there isn’t an honest beat in it. There are some high quality special effects, some near-death sphincter-tightening moments and a cool jet ski chase through a flooded middle school, but that’s about it. The only thing truly impressive about this film is that they made it, that no one got electrocuted, and that the actors fulfilled their contracts and didn’t say the hell with this and quit after like day three.</p>
<p>So why bother to mention it? It’s so bad I kind of want you to experience it for yourselves. There are quippy one liners that are so awful and poorly timed that you’ll want to cover your ears. There’s one particular performance from an ancillary actor that is so bad, so thoroughly, shockingly terrible, that it destroys every scene the actor is in. I won’t say who. You’ll have to watch it and see. That’s where you have to step in as a director and go: <em>this person is killing my film</em> and replace them right away. But I’m assuming they couldn’t because no other actor would sign on to be that wet for that long for scale.</p>

<p>How does it end? Who cares! I mean, the ending is piss, too, but by the time you get there you’ll have fallen in love with this miserable chronicle of insanity. You’ll have a new appreciation for crews and lighting and how hard it is to pick the right project. You’ll feel like you’ve been cleansed, metaphorically, by the struggle of the wet actors, and you’ll marvel at how bad a movie can be when it makes Betty White irritating. It’s a feat that I <em>never </em>thought possible. Betty White is a national treasure.</p>
<p><em>Hard Rain</em>. A travesty. Watch it now, on Plex.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On this day in history, <strong>May 1st, 1941</strong>, <em>Citizen Kane</em> debuted in New York City. Widely considered among the greatest films of all time, it inspired us to shuffle through our own catalog to find some films that move us, make us think and keep us connected. Perhaps nothing is more important for a drama than being able to capture and transport the viewer, and to that end we’ve chosen five films that grab you by the lapels and spirit you away. From inspirational love stories to fighting international terrorism and right back down to suicide in the heartland, if you’re ready to hit those particular emotional octaves, and many more, there’s something for you to watch, for free, on Plex.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in, shall we?</p>

<p><em>The Illusionist</em> often gets lumped in with another magician movie, <em>The Prestige</em>, which also came out in 2006. They’re both great, both dark, both feature illusionists, both have excellent writing, directing and acting, and both have marvelous, jaw-dropping, holy shit endings. They’re so similar, in fact, that sometimes people assume they’ve seen both when they’ve only seen one.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Prestige</em> is the one where the two illusionists vie for prestige in London.</li>
<li><em>The Illusionist</em> is about only one illusionist, in love with <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/jessica-biel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Biel</a>, in Vienna.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what I know and adore about this movie: if you watch the first 15 minutes and you’re not absolutely hooked, check your pulse because homie: <em>you dead</em>. I rewatched this recently and I couldn’t get over how well-handled I felt as a viewer. Director <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/neil-burger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neil Burger</a> takes great pains to lay out a rich, imaginative story, and before you know it, you’re fully invested. I love a film where I can relax because I know I’m in capable hands.</p>

<p>If you already love <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/edward-norton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Norton</a>, congrats! Then you’re going to really click with this film.</p>
<p>If you’re more in the camp of thinking “Man, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/edward-norton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ed Norton</a> irritates me and he has such a punchable face.” Then it might take you a tad longer to settle in with <em>The Illusionist</em>. Even with a substantial barrier to entry like that, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/edward-norton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norton&#8217;s</a> talent is palpable and will likely overwhelm the part of you that just plain doesn’t cotton to him as an actor.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16123 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ed-norton-face-1024x575.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ed-norton-face-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ed-norton-face-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ed-norton-face-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ed-norton-face-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ed-norton-face-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ed-norton-face-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ed-norton-face-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ed-norton-face.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><em>The Illusionist</em> is visually striking, lovingly paced and enjoyable. <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/rufus-sewell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rufus Sewel</a> is perfectly cast as Crown Prince Leopold, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/edward-norton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norton</a>holds center as the titular illusionist and <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/paul-giamatti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Giamatti</a> plays chief inspector Walter Uhl in a role so good your Italian aunt will bite her knuckle in appreciation.</p>

<p><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/marlee-matlin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marlee Matlin</a> won the best actress Oscar for her portrayal of a deaf woman who chooses to remain speechless in a world that tries to push her to be vocal. This is a film from a different era, certainly, and the pace can sometimes prove daunting to a modern audience.</p>
<p>For example, when’s the last time you saw someone turn on a lamp in a movie? I counted no less than four times in <em>Children of a Lesser God</em>. That should give you some insight into the level of realism and the relative velocity of the script. Be warned: young <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/william-hurt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Hurt</a> be lamping up in this bitch.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16136 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/william-hurt-1024x575.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/william-hurt-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/william-hurt-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/william-hurt-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/william-hurt-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/william-hurt-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/william-hurt-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/william-hurt-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/william-hurt.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>That said, I’m smitten with the understated beauty of the title- just think about the meaning of that: <em>Children of a Lesser God</em>. It’s magnificent. Then there’s the (late) always excellent <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/philip-bosco" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philip Bosco</a>,</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16127 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/philip-bosco-1024x575.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/philip-bosco-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/philip-bosco-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/philip-bosco-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/philip-bosco-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/philip-bosco-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/philip-bosco-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/philip-bosco-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/philip-bosco.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>and the memorable and brave performance by <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/marlee-matlin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marlee Matlin</a>. It’s a film that gives us a glimpse into a world too many of us pass right by, and the shared humanity we sometimes take for granted.</p>
<h3>3. Patriot Games</h3>
<p><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/movie/patriot-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Watch Free Now </strong>►</a></p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16125 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/patriot-games-1024x772.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/patriot-games-1024x772.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/patriot-games-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/patriot-games-768x579.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/patriot-games-1536x1159.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/patriot-games-1440x1086.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/patriot-games-800x603.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/patriot-games-640x483.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/patriot-games-400x302.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/patriot-games-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/patriot-games.jpg 1665w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>I can’t say for sure how many times I’ve watched <em>Patriot Games</em> over the years but it’s enough that I can recite most of it by heart, and even anticipate some of the <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/harrison-ford" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harrison Ford</a> trademark facial gestures. My friends would groan audibly if they could tell you how often I pick up the phone and yell “Get me Hostage Rescue out of Quantico, now!”</p>
<p>The story follows Ford’s Jack Ryan as he is targeted and attacked for foiling an assassination attempt on a member of the English royal family. When everything breaks down, Ryan, a career analyst, is forced to take matters into his own hands and play a deadly game of cat and mouse with an insane terrorist whose only mission in life is to kill Ryan and his family.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16128 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-bean-1024x575.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-bean-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-bean-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-bean-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-bean-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-bean-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-bean-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-bean-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-bean.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>It’s tough to dislike boy scout Jack Ryan, and this exploration of terrorism and political expeditiousness is hot-primed with enough gunfights to keep you on the edge of your seat. While many people have a quiet mistrust of spooks, I think one of the reasons Jack Ryan resonates so much with people, and with me, specifically, is that we desperately want to believe that the intelligence services are full of people as noble and ethical as Jack Ryan.</p>
<p><em>Patriot Games</em> is probably the best way (along with <em>The Hunt for Red October</em>) to see that play out, and it allows you to do the most universal thing in Western cinema: watch <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/sean-bean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Bean</a> die on screen. <em>Again.</em> Come for the political intrigue, stay for the cultured loveliness of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/anne-archer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Archer</a>, who never, ever gets the credit she deserves.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16119 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/anne-archer-1024x575.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/anne-archer-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/anne-archer-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/anne-archer-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/anne-archer-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/anne-archer-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/anne-archer-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/anne-archer-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/anne-archer.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In fact, Archer’s character of Cathy Ryan was sort of life-changing for me. I remember first seeing <em>Patriot Games</em> while married to my first wife, who was a passionate but volatile woman, and thinking “Really? Can you really have a partner who is loving <em>and</em> hyper-capable <em>and</em> whip-smart <em>and</em> also calm under pressure? Do women like that even exist?” Fast forward many years to now, past the indiscretions of youth, still friends with my ex, but now I’m partnered up with a vibrant, intelligent, wonderful, caring woman. A woman who, like Cathy Ryan, is calm, thoughtful and insightful. A woman who makes everyone better around her. You guys would love her. Are brilliant, amazing, cultured, evolved women real? Hell, yes they are! I can personally attest: they’re real, and they’re spectacular.</p>

<p><em>Dead Man Walking</em> is about as capable as a film can be, thanks in no small part to the outstanding script and direction of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/tim-robbins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Robbins</a>. In only his second directing gig, Robbins gives you reason to resent him for talent that’s so staggering that it almost makes you forget what a gifted actor he is.</p>

<p>Powered incandescently by the Oscar-winning performance of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/susan-sarandon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Susan Sarandon</a> as Sister Helen Prejean, a nun trying to help a convicted rapist and murderer find salvation before he is executed for his crimes, <em>Dead Man Walking</em> is one of those films that knocks you directly onto your ass. If you&#8217;re in the mood for a trip down humanity&#8217;s bleaker streets, put away the Instagram feed and get ready to cozy up to some death row drama. Bonus points for watching it with someone who differs with you on the topic of capital punishment!</p>
<p>It’s not a fast-paced movie, either, so you experience the plot reveals in conjunction with the characters, which makes the oncoming drumbeat of death that much more present. Basically, it’s a long road to hoe until about the last fifteen minutes where you really get to see <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/sean-penn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Penn’s</a> acting chops. I once suspected he had none, after watching him and <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/madonna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna</a> in <em>Shanghai Surprise</em>, but you can’t argue with the talent on display as the realization hits his character Matthew Poncelet, and he struggles to both cope with the inevitability of his own demise and to make amends for the pain his actions have caused.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16129 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-penn-1024x575.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-penn-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-penn-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-penn-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-penn-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-penn-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-penn-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-penn-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sean-penn.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>I always like to call out the bit parts played by outstanding actors, and we get a glimpse of two here. In the flashback sequences where we see the teens Poncelet killed, the boy is played by a young <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/peter-sarsgaard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Sarsgaard</a> and Poncelet’s younger brother Craig is played by <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/jack-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Black</a>.</p>

<p>Shot beautifully by master DP Roger Deakins, it’s not only a joy to watch, but a clinic in narrative structure and character development, and a film that will leave an impression on you, long after it’s over.</p>

<p>I was admittedly late to the game on <em>The Virgin Suicides</em>, because the premise didn’t immediately grab me as a twenty-something, and now terrifies me as a forty-something with teenage daughters. The highly-regarded debut film from <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/sofia-coppola" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sofia Coppola</a> is an aspirational movie, which sets the stage for her film career, and is shot with an ethereal, almost dreamlike feel.</p>
<p>Based on the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, <em>The Virgin Suicides</em> is an exploration of the upper middle class in the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe in the 1970s. The story focuses on the Lisbon girls, five teenage sisters from 13 to 17, all of whom take their own lives. It’s such a macabre story, but Coppola somehow manages to dull the edges of it, making it feel more like an epic poem. Still, if you’re anything like me, the loss of life at that age is nearly too sad to endure.</p>
<p>The cast is full of talent. <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/kirsten-dunst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirsten Dunst</a> leads the way as Lux Lisbon, the most notable of the daughters.</p>

<p>I wish I could comment on the relationship between the film and the Eugenides novel, but I fear I might have a Eugenides block. Friends have urged me to read his high watermark book, <em>Middlesex</em>, and I’ve started it and set it down on three different occasions. Not sure why.</p>
<p>The film has an unnamed, unseen narrator who did an excellent job and who turned out to be Giovanni Ribisi. Mostly, we see these girls as muses, observed in near reverence through the eyes of neighborhood boys, one of whom is played by an adolescent <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/hayden-christensen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hayden Christensen</a>.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16120 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/boys-1024x575.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/boys-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/boys-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/boys-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/boys-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/boys-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/boys-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/boys-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/boys.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The Lisbon sisters represent the very pinnacle of desire for the neighborhood boys and yet remain, somehow, ultimately unknowable. Many critics rank <em>The Virgin Suicides</em> next to <em>Lost in Translation</em> as <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/sofia-coppola" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Coppola&#8217;s</a> more profound successes, but I’ll be honest that I greatly preferred the latter. Still, if you’re anything like me, you’ll revel in the nostalgia and immediately add the soundtrack to your Plex playlist. It kicks all the ass.</p>
<p>Did you make it through? Are you okay? Anyone need a hug? The five films above are a real trip, and there are moments in each that are memorable. As we live through this bizarre time, did anything hit you as particularly powerful? Were you triggered at all? Did any of the films leave you flat? Don’t be shy!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The romantic poet Lord Byron once quipped “always laugh when you can, it is cheap medicine” and my god is it high time for a laugh. People are stuck in their homes, rationing toilet paper and watching their teens dance on TikTok. We’re like three Tina Turner sing-strides away from Thunderdome (will speargun for flour @me) and so what better time to laugh it up?</p>
<p>This month we’ll explore five comedies you can watch for free on Plex, and hopefully, the laughter will provide a period of blissful retreat from the malaise of cabin fever around us all.</p>

<p>We usually do fairy tales with the handsome prince saving the poor peasant girl, but the reversal in this film is a welcome change. <em>She’s Out Of My League</em> is what happens when a stunning, self-made woman falls for a TSA worker, and the various complications involved in such a pairing. In one way, it’s a love letter to the city of Pittsburgh, which is vastly underrated. In another way it’s an investigation about ingrained class warfare and how we’re often our own worst critic.</p>
<p>But honestly, the movie is too busy bringing the funny to even tip its hat to those themes. It’s a fairly down-the-middle romantic comedy that does a solid job of toeing the line between witty and smutty. <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/jay-baruchel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay Baruchel</a> plays the lead and I kept hoping for him to rise above the preconceived pigeonholing of his looks and his vocation to be the type of man who could justify Cinderella coming to woo him, but I’m not sure he ever really rose to the occasion. Still, the supporting cast is sharp and funny, and <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/alice-eve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alice Eve</a> is so beautiful it’s kind of unfair. Come for her loveliness and stay for the inspired snark of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/krysten-ritter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Krysten Ritter</a>.</p>

<p>The movie is fun, and while the language may be a tad rough for some viewers, mostly you have an easy, by-the-numbers romantic comedy where you’ll laugh at the wacky ancillary players and root like crazy for the two leads.</p>

<h3>&#8220;Yeah, but if I introduce you, will you not be a dickhead and not call me names and don&#8217;t say anything stupid or mean and don&#8217;t like punch me in the face?&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Drinking Buddies</em> is less a destination than a journey. Directed by <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/joe-swanberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Swanberg</a>, it’s part of the mumblecore world of films: basically a long improv sketch. Swanberg introduced the actors to the premise, gave them a few guidelines, and rolled cameras four days later. Just writing that makes my stomach tighten up, but because of the chemistry of the talented leads, the results were pretty impressive.</p>
<p><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/jake-johnson-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake Johnson</a> leads a cast of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/olivia-wilde" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Wilde</a>, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/ron-livingston" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron Livingston</a> and <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/anna-kendrick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Kendrick</a> with an assist from <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/jason-sudeikis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Sudeikis</a>. It’s generally a story about two brewery workers with a special connection and a glimpse at the people they’re dating. But this is certainly one where your mileage may vary. Some people love the authenticity of the world, others have trouble waiting for more scripted plot points to happen. I found the subtle commentary on functional alcoholism interesting and it reminded me of the type of relationship angst I was glad to grow past.</p>
<p>Now, I have to admit, I’m a little biased because I’ve had a moderate crush on <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/olivia-wilde" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Wilde</a> since seeing her in a tiny role in 2004’s <em>The Girl Next Door</em>.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16114 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia-1024x435.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia-1024x435.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia-300x127.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia-1536x652.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia-1800x764.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia-1440x611.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia-800x340.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia-640x272.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia-400x170.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia-150x64.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/olivia.jpg 2000w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>And I’m a huge, huge <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/jake-johnson-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake Johnson</a> fan from his work on <em>New Girl</em> and <em>Stumptown</em> and basically everything he does. I can’t get enough of the guy. He’s great in everything. Except this picture where his feet are filthy because I kind of have a feet aversion. Dude has some deep-ass arches. But in general, every role he touches he turns to gold.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16112 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch-1024x435.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch-1024x435.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch-300x127.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch-1536x652.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch-1800x764.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch-1440x611.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch-800x340.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch-640x272.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch-400x170.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch-150x64.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jake-arch.jpg 2000w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>It’s also kind of interesting to see how many people have migrated from Team Kendrick to Team Wilde over the years. (If you haven’t seen Olivia Wilde’s <em>Booksmart</em>, by the way, do so tout suite). But that said, this is a polarizing film. I was very open to it and it worked, but I have co-workers who loathe this movie and will drunk-yell about it all night if you give them enough Hefeweizen. (Which I often did before an invisible pathogen shut down the human race).</p>
<p>If you’re able to just relax and let <em>Drinking Buddies</em> come to you in its disarming sort of way, you have a chance to be really charmed by it.</p>

<p><em>Wonder Boys</em> is just about as close as you can get to a film feeling like a novel. It’s the one movie that makes me simultaneously feel both old and young. We open in a creative writing seminar, migrate through a rainy car ride and land in an academic cocktail party on a snowy night in Pittsburgh. You can almost smell the tweed when you start watching.</p>
<p>And then you smell the weed.</p>
<p>Starring <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/michael-douglas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Douglas</a> as an emotionally dispirited professor, we follow him down a liberal arts rabbit hole as he loses a wife and gets caught up in a series of bizarro events that still manage to maintain a put-upon literary quality.</p>
<p>The rest of the cast is stellar. <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/frances-mcdormand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frances McDormand</a>, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/tobey-maguire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tobey Maguire</a>, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/robert-downey-jr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Downey Jr.</a>, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/katie-holmes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katie Holmes</a> and <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/rip-torn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rip Torn</a> bring the script to life, and capture the most heartfelt moments of the <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/michael-chabon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Chabon</a> novel upon which it’s based. McDormand is so amazing in this that it hurts my bones to watch. She’s a living legend.</p>
<p><em>Wonder Boys</em> is a jewel in the directing crown of the late Curtis Hanson, one of Douglas’s best performances, and Downey Jr.&#8217;s before he was Iron Man. In fact, without this role, and his later one in 2005’s <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</em>, I’d posit that there never would have been a Tony Stark in his future. And lest you misunderstand me, <em>Wonder Boys</em> isn’t your grandpappy’s literary movie. Guns, dogs, sex, unexpected babies, cops, drugs, infidelity, stolen cars and of course, Marilyn Monroe all vie for screen time in this deeply moving, relatively unheralded masterpiece. I adore this movie. Hard stop.</p>

<p><em>Big Night</em> is like being hungry and then gorging yourself with your favorite food. It doesn’t just fill the hole, it feeds the soul.</p>
<p>It’s a relatively small story: Despite having a virtuoso chef, an Italian restaurant is facing foreclosure and must plan one hail Mary dinner to save it all. But inside of that premise, the language crackles. A combination of outstanding writing, note-perfect acting and masterful directing, <em>Big Night</em> takes you back to the Jersey Shore before gym, tan &amp; laundry. The 1950s, when the sky was the limit and the American dream lured people from every nation in the world to make it big. The cast, itself, is kind of jaw-dropping:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/tony-shalhoub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Shalhoub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/stanley-tucci" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stanley Tucci</a></li>

<li><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/isabella-rossellini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isabella Rossellini</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/ian-holm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Holm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/campbell-scott" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Campbell Scott</a></li>

<li><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/marc-anthony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Anthony</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But the relationships? The stress and the passion? The music! The dancing! It’s all wrapped up into a little package sure to be adored by foodies, but accessible to anyone who’s had to navigate the landmines of a tight-knit family. As much drama as it is comedy, I put it here because it’s honest and powerful and the small moments make me laugh out loud.</p>

<p>There are only two groups of people in the Clueniverse: people who understand that <em>Clue</em> is one of the greatest comedies ever made, and people who don’t <em>yet </em>realize that. Unlike many titles from the 1980s, <em>Clue</em> is timeless. A Whodunit for the ages. The jokes are evergreen and the comedic timing is spot on.</p>

<p>If you like physical comedy, <em>Clue</em> is your Huckleberry. <em>Clue</em> giveth and <em>Clue</em> taketh away, often in the same scene. In addition, it features multiple endings, which was a daunting undertaking in the 1980s but is now a delight that wraps up the film with a nice bow. A legendary ensemble cast, a shrewd script and lightning-fast repartee make <em>Clue</em> a revelation that never gets old and never disappoints. I’ve watched it probably fifty times and I still laugh like an insane person on meth every time I see it.</p>
