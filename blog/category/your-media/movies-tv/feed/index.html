<h3>Crackle adds thousands of more free movies and TV shows to Plex</h3>
<p>Welp, Plexians, you’ve devoured tens and tens of MILLIONS of minutes of Plex Free Movies and TV. You dined on <em>The Terminator</em>, gnawed on <em>Lord of War</em>, and satiated your sweet tooth with <em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/movie/take-me-home-tonight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take Me Home Tonight</a></em>. Every month we’ve been adding new titles and rounding out our offering — expanding the menu as it were. Today, however, we’re basically adding a whole new dining room (apologies for the tortured metaphor, but we’re darn hungry).</p>
<h3>You’re the captain now</h3>

<p>Plex users in the US will now be able to stream more individual movies than you can stream on Netflix — and in case you missed that word a few times it’s f-r-e-e. So grab the latest update for your Plex app and get crackle-ing (sorry, but we couldn’t resist).</p>

<p>Plex users in the states will also enjoy all the delicious Crackle original content, such as <em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/on-point" target="_blank&quot;" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Point</a></em>, a basketball docuseries following three high school players as they move toward their goal of an NBA career, and <em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/yelawolf-a-slumerican-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yelawolf: A Slumerican Life</a></em>, a reality-tinged journey through the life of Cherokee rapper and artist from Alabama, Yelawolf.</p>
<p>And given that Plex streams to over 200 countries around the world, we’re working on new partnerships to deliver even more <strong>free</strong> streaming content to all our friends around the world in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more on that front shortly.</p>
<h3>Rubbing elbows with the stars</h3>
<p>Okay, this is the part where we tastefully namedrop some big names. Our new Crackle offering will join movies and TV shows from the world’s biggest publishing studios, including <a href="https://www.mgm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM)</a>, <a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/company/divisions/television/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warner Bros.

<h3>We’re gonna need a bigger blog</h3>

<p>If you’re like us and you struggle with figuring out what to watch (cue the sweaty flashback to Ye Olde Blockbuster, where you stared at thousands of titles but had no idea what to get), now we have a helpful new side-blog called “<a href="https://www.plex.tv/the-watch-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Watch List</a>.” There you’ll find some fun and unreasonably-opinionated posts that dive deep into specific genres, themes, and moods. Basically a clickable, curated list of movies that you can start streaming immediately — exactly what you wish you’d had in your pocket when you were staring at 30 identical copies of The Last Action Hero at Blockbuster. Click on The Watch List icon above and read about “<a href="https://www.plex.tv/watch-list/6-heist-movies-to-steal-your-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 Heist Movies To Steal Your Heart</a>” or “<a href="https://www.plex.tv/watch-list/5-actual-laugh-out-loud-comedies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Actual Laugh-Out-Loud Comedies</a>” or “<a href="https://www.plex.tv/watch-list/3-early-films-from-future-hollywood-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 Early Films From Future Hollywood Legends</a>” until the cows come home. The current blog you know and love (or at the very least, are very currently reading) will stay the same as it ever was, and continue to bring you updates on new features and under-the-hood dives into the Plex platform.</p>
<h3>We are sweating the deets</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16078" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/look-at-me.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>While we’re excited to share today’s new cache of free awesome content, rest assured that we’re already hard at work making Plex the premier entertainment platform around the world (we know, dream big!). Keep an eye peeled for new updates in the coming months (shhh… it’s top secret but really cool) that’ll make browsing, discovering, and streaming your movies and shows even more funtastic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Um. Suffice it to say that a lot has happened since we last blogged a few months back. This may not be your typical Plex blog post, but it’ll probably be one of the least crazy things to happen today. </p>
<p>Quite a few of you have reached out to share how much Plex has helped over the past weeks and how it fits in to your shelter-in-place regimen, whether it’s keeping kids from tearing each other’s hair out, or keeping family and friends fed with a steady stream of media to pass the time. To be clear, we’re on the far fringes of being able to make a meaningful contribution to returning things to normal. While we’re not working on the cure*, we’re incredibly honored to know that we’re working on something that may make the mitigation a little more tolerable for all of you. It gives us a renewed sense of purpose. We won’t let you down.</p>
<h3>28 <del>Days</del> <del>Hours</del> Minutes Later</h3>
<p>This isn’t a Hands Across America sort of post—no false platitudes. For us, the reason we built Plex was that we always loved getting lost in stories. Movies and TV shows, documentaries and anime, old favorites as well as wild new experiences. To share a personal guilty pleasure, in times like this we’re comforted by watching really bad, really stupid, “c’mon you can’t be seriously watching that” comedies. Other people curl up with a good zombie movie. Others binge all the reality shows that seemed so trite before but now just might be able to deliver a much-needed moment of zen. Whatever your go-to jam is, we hope you get a chance to take a break every now and again. Okay! Now on to the rest of our blog.</p>
<h3>First, if you’re an educator quickly adapting to online classes, Plex might be able to help<br />
</h3>
<p>To be clear, this is a bit of a stretch for us as we’re a relatively small company, but we have a platform that might be of value to educators out there. We are aware of a number of schools (and hospitals, churches, and even a submarine!) that have used Plex to stream licensed and teacher-generated videos in classrooms. We’ve recently helped a San Francisco Bay Area school that suddenly needed to figure out how to distribute this content remotely via tablets and web browsers. We were able to donate the costs associated with the remote software, as well as provide early access to a new feature we’re working on, single item sharing, so teachers can now share their playlists or specific content directly with their classes. If you’re an educational institution that may benefit from using Plex, email us details at <a href="mailto:edu@plex.tv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">edu@plex.tv</a> so we can understand what you are looking to do, assess the demand, and see how we might be able to help. </p>
<h3>A few tips on Remote Working, aka how to have a conference call in your kid’s closet</h3>
<p>From day one, we’ve been a completely remote company, working out the kinks of “working in your bedroom / dining room / garage / (hopefully sleeping) baby’s nursery” for the last 10 years. We’re spread across six different continents, so we’re well-versed in the tradeoffs of which time zone gets the short end of the stick to get up at 5 AM to make that conference call (sorry Team Australia). So at Plex, we’re all used to the hassle of video communication and with the paradise and the disaster that comes with working at home. For many of you, welcome to the new normal. If you’re new to the game, here’s <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/work-from-home?utm_source=plex&#038;utm_medium=plex-blog&#038;utm_campaign=plex-blog-this-is-fine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a great post with 47 specific WFH hacks</a> as well as a recent Forbes post (by our very own Keith Valory) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/03/25/communication-and-collaboration-the-keys-to-successful-remote-work/#6bba94212a0b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on setting up your business for WFH</a>.</p>
<h3>Okay, another thing. For the next 3 months, Live TV will be free—no Plex Pass required</h3>
<p>If you have an HD antenna and tuner, then now you can stream your free live TV to all your devices without Plex Pass through the end of June (DVR and other premium features still require a Plex Pass). And if you don’t, we got some of our hardware partners to offer them to Plex users <a href="https://www.plex.tv/ad/community-love-plex-fam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at a discount for a limited time</a>. You can stream reruns, new shows (treasure them!), news, or kids programming. Stream it all around your home or while you’re away. Maybe it will help educate, entertain, enlighten, or another e-starting-word. <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/live-tv-over-the-air-functionality-free-for-the-next-3-months/561368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Get the details here</a>. We’ve been working especially hard to fix lots of issues with Live TV based on thoughtful feedback from the community. Stay tuned for more details on that soon.<br />

<h3>(*) Other ways to help</h3>
<p>We’ll leave it to others more knowledgeable in your local communities and countries on how best to donate and support each other financially and emotionally. We do know many of you probably have some spare CPU and GPU cycles lying around, though, so we’d like to highlight an opportunity to put them to work with <a href="https://foldingathome.org/covid19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">folding@home</a> (feel free to join “<a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/249802" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Team Plex</a>” #249802 if you don’t already have a team). As they say, “Each simulation you run is like buying a lottery ticket. The more tickets we buy, the better our chances of hitting the jackpot.” So by all means, let’s go make some more lottery tickets.</p>
<h3>And if you’ve read this far, yes, we do have an Official Unofficial Plex Coloring Book for you to download</h3>
<p>The least we can do (and we mean that quite literally) is make a Plex coloring book. (Thanks again Team Australia!) After all the movies have been watched, board games have been played, podcasts have been, um, podded, and you get to that point of maximum boredom, we present to you the official unofficial Plex coloring book. Take your frustration out in colored pencil form. Print it out. Doodle. Draw. Or share your kid’s (or your) best efforts on Facebook or Instagram for a chance to earn some Plex swag. <a href="https://assets.plex.tv/marketing/coloring-book/plex-coloring-book-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.<br />

<h3>Togethertude</h3>
<p>So in closing, during this period of uncertainty, hopefully you’ve got some family with you, some friends, or at least on-screen companions reaching out from their own couches, a town, or a country over. Just know we’ll be joining you, finding a moment of escape and perhaps even the briefest but most delicious slice of joy. Stay safe out there (or more likely, in there). We’re here for you.</p>
<p>So what are your hacks for surviving indoors in this unusual new time? Let us know in the comments down below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not gonna lie, it’s been a big couple of weeks for us. We launched a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/boom-we-just-dinosized-your-movie-collection-for-free/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pretty major new thing</a> just about a week ago. It was a big effort. However, many pointed out that it’s a little bit outside of our comfort zone, and well, you’re not wrong. It’s an area of growth that we’re excited about and pushes Plex into brave, new, and exciting waters. We’re also pumped that it delivers on our long-term vision of bringing all the media you and your family enjoy into a single platform. One powerful, beautiful, and customizable platform that works smoothly and consistently no matter where and how you stream.<br />

<p>Unfortunately, as is the way of logic on the internet, some folks went on to proclaim this the “End of Plex”: it’s only a matter of time (or so the thinking goes) before we kick our loyal Media Server users to the curb in pursuit of glorious, ad-supported world domination. Well, we can very clearly state that nothing could be further from the truth. Personal media is the very core of that long-term vision, and we’re just as invested as you in making it a reality.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at some of the major improvements we’ve made over the past year.</p>
<h3>First, some core playback improvements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced and expanded playback capabilities on Android, Apple TV, and iOS.</li>
<li>Best-in-class media players on Android, iOS and Apple TV, bringing better format support, smoother playback, and overall higher quality viewing.</li>
<li>Expanded and improved support for hardware-accelerated transcoding.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next, a bunch of music-related goodness:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/find-that-tune/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Greatly improved music features</a>, scanning, and metadata.</li>
<li>TIDAL integration, including the ability to “add to library,” making TIDAL music your own.</li>
<li>Automatically find related albums and tracks for movies and TV episodes.</li>

<p>And these are just some of the highlights among dozens of little features and hundreds of bug fixes, all in support of making Plex the best thing on the planet for your media.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to gently dispel some of the more fantastical doomsday rumors that have bubbled their way through the series of tubes. Bonus points if I can clear up some actual misconceptions along the way.</p>
<p>First, we’re as committed as ever to the needs of our media-loving, server-owning, fiercely independent community who’s been with us from the beginning. We don’t take this community for granted, and believe me, we’d sooner give up our phones (uh, no) than drive you away.</p>
<p>Second, our goal is to prioritize your personal media first, and add this new, free media as an optional supplement to you and your family. Your library is still front and center, but now there’s more to choose from if you happen to come up short. Managing multiple sources can be a bit of a tightrope act at times, and (believe it or not!) we may encounter a bug or two along the way. Have a real-world example where we got it wrong? Know that we’re listening and always trying to improve. Feedback is always welcome and appreciated. Oh, and if you or your family play things from one of these new sources, it will have no performance impact at all on your server; it comes straight from us. </p>
<p>Third—and this should <a href="https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">go without saying</a>—we do not collect information about the contents of your personal library. We do not run ads against your personal media. We don’t share this info with anyone (given we don’t know it in the first place, how could we?). Nothing here has changed with the rollout of free movies &#038; TV.</p>
<p>So there you have it. We’re excited about where this next year will take us on all fronts. As you know, everyone at Plex uses and loves the product on a daily basis. So trust us when we say that we’re continuing to build the product and the company to be something that we’re all proud of and that everyone genuinely enjoys using: old-timers, new-timers, and even the crotchety internet tube users as well. Plex is a lifelong labor of love—we thank you all for helping us dream big and keep our aim true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us are huge, huge music nerds here at Plex, so it probably makes sense that we&#8217;re always looking for ways to make music in Plex even more awesome. We&#8217;ve been hard at work on some pretty sweet improvements, and I wanted to share a little bit about them (okay, maybe a lot about them) and talk about another cool way to discover new music that we&#8217;re rolling out this week.</p>
<p>First, the tl;dr of what the recent improvements mean for your music library: Music matching and recognition is now super fast and super accurate, and for the first time there&#8217;s a way for you to <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/correcting-your-music-content-matches/">contribute and make it even better for everyone</a>. Metadata has been significantly leveled up (improved artwork! improved artist bios! styles! album reviews!). And if you&#8217;re the kind of&#8230; particular&#8230; music lover who has a perfectly organized and tagged collection, we&#8217;ve made a bunch of fixes to make sure your efforts are reflected in your Plex library. There is no longer a choice between basic and premium music libraries, everyone can take advantage of the new hotness! Basic libraries can even be seamlessly upgraded, learn how <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/upgrade-music-libraries-new-metadata-system/">here</a>.</p>
<p>But before I get into some overly-geeky details on how all that works&#8230; I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve been watching a movie or TV show and thought &#8220;this track is awesome! I wonder what it is?&#8221;, only to find myself down a Wikipedia rabbit hole, or, god forbid, watching the 15 minutes of closing credits looking for clues. Honestly, we’ve discovered some of our favorite music this way over the years, but that&#8217;s no way to live.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there&#8217;s a Better Way: we&#8217;ve harnessed the encyclopedic knowledge of the lovely community over at <a href="https://www.tunefind.com/">Tunefind</a> to bring you the answers. You can now find albums and tracks from movies and TV episodes, listed right alongside other related media, right in your Plex library! The results are powered by TIDAL (which is by itself pretty awesome—we love bringing universes of media together), so with a linked TIDAL subscription, you&#8217;ve got instant access to listen right then and there! Don&#8217;t have TIDAL? No fear, you still get those 30-second previews so you can still figure out what track you heard. This feature is now available on pretty much every platform we support, as long as you are running the latest version of our software.*</p>
<p>At launch, soundtracks and related tracks will be available, courtesy of Tunefind, and will show up for movies and TV episodes you have on your own server—your shared users don’t have access yet.</p>

<p>Okay, so how did we go about overhauling your music library? The first step was leveling up the process of scanning and recognizing all the music in your collection. It&#8217;s a surprisingly tricky task, and our existing solutions were either showing signs of age or dependent on proprietary third-party solutions that we could no longer rely on. So like any self-respecting engineer staring at an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">empty editor</a>, we looked to the internet. It turns out the folks over at <a href="https://beets.io">Beets</a> have been thinking about this exact problem for a long time, and they&#8217;ve created an amazingly capable, open source tool that provided lots of inspiration for the foundation of our new scanner. Another bit of special sauce that&#8217;s critical to identifying harder-to-recognize tracks is audio fingerprinting, a magical technology that &#8220;listens&#8221; to a few seconds of the track and searches for matches based on the actual audio instead of relying on file names or tags. For this, we turned to another open, crowd-sourced solution: <a href="https://acoustid.org">AcoustID</a>. After weaving the various pieces together, and <i>lots </i>of tuning and tweaking, we had a scanner that easily outperformed our previous efforts, posting up impressive 99%+ accuracy numbers, even on some of our more challenging test libraries full of more obscure content.</p>

<p>Historically, all of the tasty metadata that powers your Plex library has been collected by a loosely-coupled set of &#8220;agents&#8221; that live on your server, each one responsible for talking to a single metadata source, with a framework responsible for merging everything together to present the full picture. For example, plot summaries may come from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org">The Movie DB</a>, ratings from <a href="https://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>, and reviews from <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. For the most part this works great, but there are a few inherent limitations. First, each server&#8217;s agent stack can only be so smart about how it interleaves different pieces of metadata. It boils down to a stack-ranked list, so there&#8217;s no way to get, let&#8217;s say, artist bios from <a href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> but album art from <a href="https://fanart.tv/">fanart.tv</a>. Second, we&#8217;re entirely at the mercy of the original providers for the content. Even if we can all agree that the plot summary for a movie is too spoilery, or the season two poster for your favorite show looks like someone’s kid sister just learned Photoshop, we couldn&#8217;t tell the agents otherwise. Third, basically everyone just wants the best metadata we can find. It turns out they&#8217;re not interested in a part-time job managing metadata agent settings. Who could have guessed?</p>
<p>So, a huge part of the new music solution has been standing up our own metadata service in the cloud. It&#8217;s smart, and it combines the very best of both worlds. It&#8217;s seeded by the best metadata sources, both curated and crowd-sourced, and it&#8217;s expertly mixed to serve as a one-stop shop for the best music metadata on earth, easily accessible by your server in one convenient location.</p>
<p>Possibly the most important source in the music mix is <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">Musicbrainz</a>. It&#8217;s a vast wealth of music knowledge curated by a loving community who <em>really</em> care about the little things. We think it&#8217;s a perfect fit for our community, who also care about the little things, and we&#8217;re thrilled to have them as a key partner in serving up the very best metadata. In the event that you find something missing or, heaven forbid, outright wrong, you can now head over to Musicbrainz and fix it. As they say, a rising tide lifts all boats — you&#8217;ll be doing a good turn for your own library, helping the Musicbrainz community, and helping everyone else who places a value on pristine music metadata around the planet. It&#8217;s basically one step shy of some Ghandi level shit.</p>

<p>On top of Musicbrainz, we’ve also licensed what is widely considered the best-in-class <em>premium</em> metadata (used to power <a href="https://www.allmusic.com">AllMusic</a>, for example). The combination of these two sources for music data is fairly uncontroversially Best-on-Planet. And just to reiterate, this combination is available for all users now!</p>
<p>Okay. I&#8217;ve typed too much. I blame this excellent keyboard on my brand new MacBook (true story). If you&#8217;ve made it this far, you deserve to upgrade your shit, kick off some library radio, and soak up some Sweet Fades. You earned it.</p>
<p>* Plex Media Server version 1.18.2 or greater required; at launch, the feature will be available on iOS, Apple TV, Android Mobile, Android TV, and the Plex web app.</p>
<p>Here’s Barkley as a young pup, clearly already thinking of finding some doggo movie tunes.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! This blog post is dedicated to you, the devoted user. The one who’s been with us since early days, meticulously curating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few terabytes</a> of media goodness. The one who would be happy to see us focus on stability and core functionality, and do a bit of house cleaning along the way.</p>
<p>For years now (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/rob-lowe-literally-ama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">li-ter-ah-ly</a>) you’ve have been asking for a way to get <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/subtitle-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtitles</a> without having to go back to the computer, submit to dubious popup ads, move the subs into place, refresh the media, get distracted by a half-eaten hoagie in the fridge. Sorry, where was I? Oh right, so we’re pleased to announce a feature which makes it so easy to find and enable a subtitle, <em>you don’t even have to leave the couch</em>. We use all sorts of smarts to find you the best matches in all sorts of languages (half of all Plexians are outside the US). <strong>This feature will be rolling out as Plex Pass Preview over the next few days</strong> as we fine tune it on Web Desktop, Xbox One, most LG TVs, Plex Media Player, Android mobile, and Android TV (iOS and Apple TV will follow up shortly).</p>

<em>Android TV</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plex has been around for the better part of a decade, and software has a way of behaving like your garage: You had every intention of keeping it neat and organized, but every nook is somehow filled with Star Wars figurines and Amiibos. So it’s critical to hold the occasional yard sale and get rid of all the accumulated cruft. It’s not an uncommon thing for a software company to do—Apple does it (et tu, OpenGL?), and so does Google (RIP Inbox, Reader).</p>
<p>The Plex ecosystem is quite large, and over the years, we’ve sometimes added things that might have made sense at the time, but didn’t age well. We’ve also been <em>incredibly</em> reluctant to take anything away from people who may be using a given feature. Or kill support for a platform with low usage or other challenges. And while any given case might not be significant, they can add up over a decade to a death by a thousand (paper) cuts. So we set out to do some house-cleaning&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn’t approach the process lightly; we looked over usage numbers and took into account maintenance costs and general customer satisfaction. In some cases, we have plans for a future in which a better replacement shows up. Other things, we’re just stabbing in the chest repeatedly with a wooden stake (and hoping it’s not a zombie). But the philosophy is the same—<em>we want to focus our finite energy on providing awesome functionality that works great and makes the folks who use it happy</em>. Without further ado, here’s the list of things we’re retiring:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Plugins</strong>: This was not a decision taken lightly, as they’ve been around for a long time, and we’ve had good times both writing and using them. But bluntly, hardly anyone uses them (less than 2% of users), the ancient protocol they use is a continued pain for clients to support, and if we were to build the feature again, we’d do it very differently in this day and age. For utility-type functionality, we love standalone apps like <a href="https://tautulli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tautulli</a> and believe this is a better approach. But don’t panic—while the Plugin Directory will soon be gone, you can still manually install plugins for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Watch Later</strong>: There’s a small handful of you who still care about this feature – just enough to form a close-knit support group – and we’re super sorry (really) if this disrupts your daily bookmarking, but the feature is costly for us to maintain, and hard to justify in the long run.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: There is very low usage, and it’s also built atop an antediluvian sync engine, so if you rely on Cloud Sync for your day-to-day, things aren’t pretty. DM us a photo of your Cloud Sync library and today’s newspaper and we’ll buy you a beer? (no, not really).</p>
<p>Lastly, as we’ve previously announced, we’re shuttering our hosted Plex Media Server in the cloud (Plex Cloud) as of November 30. For those of you who relied on the service, please accept our heartfelt apology.</p>
<p>So with all that house-cleaning out of the way, what else have we been doing with our newfound laser focus (and laser-equipped sharks? shh… that’s Phase Two)? A lot of good stuff, actually.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Making Sync Great <del datetime="2018-09-25T15:08:31+00:00">Again</del></strong>: We realize that over the years, our vaunted (and premium) offline sync feature hasn’t always worked as reliably as we would have hoped. We decided to form a Seal Team 6 style group tasked with assassinating as many sync bugs as they could, working with client and server groups, as well as with forum users. The team has already made great headway on fixing some of the most annoying bugs, and you’ll begin to see the fruits of their labor across the next wave of updates.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Making Players Play</strong>: We’ve convened a similar squadron of sauron-eyed swashbucklers to kill bugs in the new Android player engine. Yes, it’s awesome that it Direct Plays everything under the sun, but that doesn’t matter if it randomly stops playing Bachelor in Paradise right as Jenna is about to punch Jordan in the face. Also: that show is everything that is wrong about humans.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>The Sound of Music</strong>: Oh, and clamp down hard on your tuks, because we have some amazing music player improvements in the works. I don’t want to give too much away, but if it rhymes with schmapless, it may be coming to a platform near you. :mic-drop:</p>
<p>In conclusion, we’re working hard to improve our focus, spend time on things that matter the most, remove as many distractions as possible, improve stability of the core product, and launch more kick-ass features. Thanks for your feedback!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These new features, cleverly conjured up by James, add some welcome pizzazz to the Plex experience.</p>
<p>The first allows you to put some tracks into ~/Library/Application Support/Plex/Background Music/Main/ which are played while you are browsing around Plex. It&#8217;s a great way to personalize the media center to your taste. Personally, I think I&#8217;ll put some Zero 7 in there, or maybe some <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/146837-school-of-seven-bells-alpinisms">School of Seven Bells</a> (great album, by the way). You can use MP3 files, or even DRM iTunes AAC tracks. Please feel free to leave a comment telling us what tracks you think would make great background music as I&#8217;m curious to hear your picks.</p>
<p>I really love this next feature. When I first showed Anna, she said &#8220;That&#8217;s f&#8212;ing cool&#8221;, and she&#8217;s not prone to swearing. Essentially, we&#8217;ve compiled (thanks to James and many contributors on the forums) a collection of high quality TV theme music samples (30 seconds or less, for reasons of copyright) and stored them on the Plex servers. When you scrape your TV shows, besides downloading metadata, Plex queries our server and if available, will download the theme music. The next time you browse into a TV show, the theme music will play. It&#8217;s really hard to explain how cool this is until you see and hear it. Once you browse into Lost, for example, and the ethereal theme for the show starts playing, you&#8217;ll see how the music coupled with the fan art really provides a more complete experience for the senses.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to contribute to the growing collection of theme music, send the files (MP3, preferably, limited to 30 seconds, no need to fade in or out as that&#8217;s done in the code) to <a href="mailto:themes@plexapp.com">themes@plexapp.com</a>. Please include the TVDB ID for the show.</p>
<p>Someone in the last post commented on how Barkley looked a little too clean cut, so I&#8217;ll post this photo for comparison. That&#8217;s him opening up a can of tennis ball whoop-ass on his friend Manu. I think he gets NBC with his ears pointed like that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading John&#8217;s excellent post <a href="http://blog.kozubik.com/john_kozubik/2008/03/high-definition.html">over here</a>, I got to thinking about 1080p content (or &#8220;difficult&#8221; content, really) and how we might be able to better handle it. To begin, let&#8217;s go over the numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A typical uncompressed 1080p frame takes up 3 MB (megabytes). This is full resolution for the Y plane, and subsampled U and V planes.</li>
<li>This means that a single second of uncompressed video (24p) takes up almost 73 MB.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s a huge amount of bandwidth, compared to the compressed video. An episode of Lost I&#8217;m watching right now is hovering around 8 Mbps, which is 1 MB/sec. This is a pretty impressive compression ratio, and there also a few possibly interesting takeaways from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streaming uncompressed 1080p content over Gigabit Ethernet is theoretically possible, but only just barely.</li>
<li>Streaming uncompressed 1080p content off a typical hard drive is theoretically possible, but again, only just barely and only in &#8220;best case scenarios&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the problems we run into playing 1080p video content have to do with two the combination of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The existence of bursts of high bit-rate frame sequences (some only a second or two long, some 10s of seconds).</li>
<li>The fact that we do real-time decoding, so if a frame is late, we drop it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So here are some random ideas that were running through my head as I woke up this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decode buffer</strong>: Disk buffers work to smooth out arrival jitter in data from the disk, so we don&#8217;t we have a decode buffer to smooth out arrival jitter in the decoded frames? That way, if we run into a frame sequence where we would get behind, we can simply empty frames from the decode buffer. Since the CPU is usually ahead, we could simply decode as fast as we can, and accumulate some number of pre-decoded frames (in RAM). To keep 2 seconds of decoded frames would cost about 150MB of RAM, which is chump change these days. And even if we pre-filled the buffer before playing, the pre-roll delay would only be increased by at *most* 2 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Grid computing</strong>: Harness the power of your idle computers and have them decoding frames for you. The problem is the extreme bandwidth of the decoded frames, as mentioned. But perhaps apply some high quality MPEG-2 compression, and it becomes much more manageable. Presumably they could decode sequences between keyframes.</li>
<li><strong>Sidecar Preprocessing</strong>: Since MPEG-2 is easier to decompress, why not simply run a preprocessor over H.264 files? Any spots that are higher than a specified bitrate would be pre-decoded, encoded to high quality MPEG-2, and then stored in a &#8220;sidecar&#8221;, alongside the original media. Imagine &#8220;Planet.Earth.01.mkv&#8221; and then &#8220;Planet.Earth.01.mkv.sidecar.00:02:01-00:02:40.mpeg2&#8221; (assuming the sidecars start and end on second boundaries). The sidecar format could be anything appropriate, and it wouldn&#8217;t have to store audio or other metadata (e.g. subtitles). Best of all, they could be whacked at any point or recomputed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Of course, the sidecar media could also just be lower bit-rate H.264, that way ffmpeg wouldn&#8217;t need to be any the wiser.</p>
<p>Hope you&#8217;re all having a great weekend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I was forced to watch <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0398375/">Rumor Has It</a>. I say forced, but actually I was staring at the screen transfixed the entire time, not because of the acting (horrible), the plot (puerile) or the surprise peek at half of Jennifer Aniston&#8217;s right breast (entirely forgettable), but because of the quality of the output of the 1080p movie by our trusty little mini.</p>
<p>By the numbers: This was an x.264 encode in an MKV container. The average bitrate was 11.5MBps, with spikes between 15 and 20. Total number of frames dropped in the entire movie (counting those 20 odd that always seem to go missing at the beginning): <strong>230</strong>. The means the drop rate was 0.16%. Those dropped frames were all clustered around &#8220;difficult&#8221; scenes in the movie, and resulted in a bit of jerky movement, but no audio loss.</p>
<p>Note that at this point we are peaking at about 130-140% of the (dual core) CPU in use. This means that there is another 70% of a core doing absolutely nothing. With further improvements by the ffmpeg team, we can only do better. This was also a full-quality decode. Tweaking some of the ffmpeg settings. as suggested by <span style="font-style: italic">inloop</span> would probably improve things as well, at the expense of picture quality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, I&#8217;ve finally managed to get all my changes checked in. Here&#8217;s what seems to be working:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Music</strong>: MP3, OGG, AAC, FLAC, MPC.</li>
<li><strong>Photos</strong>: Slideshows, viewing.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>: Almost completely broken, but should show first few seconds, at turbo speed. No audio. Fun to play around with, though.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong>: ProjectM works, but there are graphical artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Misc</strong>: Video thumbnails, IMDB, AllMusic lookups.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s completely unimplemented or broken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-screen mode.</li>
<li>Python.</li>
<li>Virtual Filesystem layer (e.g. reading from RAR, zip, etc.)</li>
<li>Lots of other stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to let people play with it (hey, it&#8217;s a great music and slideshow player!), I&#8217;ve built a release. This is a really early release, so running it may corrupt your drive, give your kids chicken pox, or ruin your credit.</p>
<p>If you want to run a binary release, <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/83628909/OSXBMC-0.01.tar.gz.html">download it here</a>. Unpack it, set the XBMC_HOME environment variable to point to the XBMC directory that&#8217;s created, and try running it. Your milage may vary, and I really can&#8217;t spend much time at all tracking down end users&#8217; problems, unfortunately. I recommend you <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=56">post to the forum</a> and help each other out, if possible.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need the following libraries installed (and I recommend you use MacPorts to install them) to run the release: libcdio, libfreetype, libfribidi, libGLEW, libiconv, liblzo, libsqlite, libz.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You&#8217;ll also need to delete the file system/profiles.xml before you start, otherwise you&#8217;ll get a gray screen on boot. I should have removed this file before packaging things up. Thanks to UKP for pointing this out.</p>
<p>If you want to compile the release, hopefully because you want to help out in the development, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87054">check out the source</a> from SVN, and then use one of the three following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use XCode to build the Debug version (production has issues).</li>
<li>Use xcodebuild to build on the command line, using something like this &#8220;xcodebuild -parallelizeTargets -configuration Debug&#8221;</li>
<li>Use Eclipse to build (which will call xcodebuild). The .cproject and .project files are checked in, and you&#8217;ll need to install the CDT, of course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck.</p>
