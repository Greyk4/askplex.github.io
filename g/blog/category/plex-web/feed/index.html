<p>Yeah, well you can skip all that now.</p>

<h3>Binge-watching nirvana</h3>
<p>Introducing our brand new Plex Pass feature called (duh) Skip Intro. If you’ve ever binge-watched anything, you know the secret to achieving that smooth multi-episode groove is all about reducing the non-essentials. So our engineers sharpened their pencils and, um, slid their slide-rules in order to figure out how to dynamically skip intros for basically any type of show. That is, without having to manually identify on every single episode what is an opening intro and what is just a kick-ass music break at the start of an episode. When you add in cold-opens, different credits for different seasons, and regional variations, it starts to become a rather thorny problem. </p>
<p>Long story short, we updated your Plex Media Server to analyze your shows in the background in order to deliver some next-level pattern recognition. Once it&#8217;s finished processing, you&#8217;ll see that friendly <strong>Skip Intro</strong> button appear in your supported player app. Magic.</p>
<h3>To boldly go where no DVR has gone before</h3>
<p>Think of it as another reason to get that digital antenna and tuner and set up Plex Live TV and DVR. In addition to watching and recording dozens of HD over-the-air broadcast channels for FREE (here in the States that includes networks like CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX, and PBS plus dozens more depending on your local market), now you can skip intros on all of your recorded shows. Only two caveats: the intro sequence must be at least 20 seconds long (keep reading to see why) and you’ll need a Plex Pass for your playback device. As of today, you’ll see it working on the latest releases of our iOS, Android, Roku, Fire TV, and Web clients – once you’ve updated your Plex Media Server and let it process your TV content.</p>
<h3>Show me the histograms</h3>
<p>A little peek under the hood: The secret ingredient is creating an audio &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; out of the histogram of each episode in a given season of each TV show. It turns out that the vast majority of show intros share common audio signatures for all their episodes (at least for a specific season). After applying some heuristics and a little bit of Special Sauce<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, we&#8217;re able to predict (in almost all cases) precisely when the intro starts and ends. Voila! Get precious minutes of your life back, one episode at a time.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago we <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/remastered-thanks-to-you-our-brand-new-tv-navigation-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spelled out</a> some imminent changes to our TV UI, and intimated that great things were to come across the board. “UNO is the future!” we said (“UNO” being our internal code name for the new UI paradigm across all platforms). None of us quite knew why “UNO” was capitalized since it’s not an acronym. “Blame Jason!” we said, and Jason was asleep at the time, so we went with it.</p>
<h3>So what is all this hullabaloo about UNO anyway?</h3>
<p>In case you missed it, UNO is our latest effort to streamline the process of searching, discovering and enjoying your content in your Plex library—no matter the type, no matter the source, no matter the format. It’s an easy, elegant, and powerful system that’s consistent no matter where and how you Plex. It gives you the ultimate control over how you navigate your collection.</p>
<h3>Benefits include: Niftier navigation</h3>
<p>We restore some basic usability qualities that suffered a bit under our “type-first” implementation.</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/navigating-the-big-screen-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fewer clicks to get where you want to go.</a></li>
<li>More discoverable actions and sources.</li>
<li>More intuitive navigation patterns.</li>
<li>Fewer distractions with things you shouldn’t have to care about.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ownership and customization</h3>

<h3>A powerful new sidebar</h3>
<p>In addition to being a better use of screen space than the top menu, it lets you see all the stuff you care about, none of the stuff you don’t, and it gets out of the way when you don’t need to look at it.</p>
<h3>Rolling out wide across the Plexverse</h3>
<p>Fast forward a few months, and now we’re on the precipice of realizing that very vision: the UNO UI is rolling out across all TV platforms this week, it’s <em>super</em> close on iOS and coming thereafter on Android, but importantly this marks the mainstream release of our most sacred (and challenging!) release of all: our beloved Web app.</p>
<h3>Which brings us to our friendly neighborhood Web app</h3>
<p>The Plex Web app is a bit of a special beast, since it serves as both a super popular platform for consuming media and the singular app to admin and curate your Media Servers. We’re fairly confident this app embodies the best of both worlds: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-plex-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimate customization</a> for the media consumer and improved control and curation for the server owner and administrator. It’s always a fun balancing act between the two—and many thanks to everyone who has given feedback along the way.</p>

(It’s okay, I’m pretty sure they won’t be offended <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f937-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) The reins of your media future rest loosely in your hands… YAH!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ho ho ho! Join us this fine evening around the warming glow of your multi-core space heaters, busily slinging ones and zeros to you and yours. Pour that nog, sprinkle on some freshly grated nutmeg, and scooch your chair a little closer to that 24U rack in your basement. We&#8217;ve got some cool stuff to announce to round out 2018. Plus, Barkley does his best impression of a Sand Person #nospoilers</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard and Dancer</strong><br />
So, let&#8217;s talk about the new server Dashboard. You&#8217;ve amassed your libraries; you&#8217;ve checked them twice; you <em>still</em> have no idea who&#8217;s naughty or nice. We’re here to help! Wondering which of your buddies is availing themselves of your media goodness? Wanna know what&#8217;s most popular amongst your family? Look no further; the Dashboard answers all that and more. We’ve upgraded the basic “Now Playing” area, and we’ve added some powerful new insights for our beloved Plex Pass holders. You guys <em>literally</em> put the (almond) milk and (gluten-free) cookies on our plates.</p>

<p>One neat thing is that the server has actually been collecting data for quite some time in anticipation of this feature, so if you’ve been running a server for a while, you can actually dive back about <em>three years</em> in the media consumption graph.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/plex-dashboard-playhistory-3yrs-800x330.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-10850 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/plex-dashboard-playhistory-3yrs-800x330.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/plex-dashboard-playhistory-3yrs-300x124.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/plex-dashboard-playhistory-3yrs-768x316.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/plex-dashboard-playhistory-3yrs-1024x422.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/plex-dashboard-playhistory-3yrs-1800x741.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/plex-dashboard-playhistory-3yrs-1440x593.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/plex-dashboard-playhistory-3yrs-640x264.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/plex-dashboard-playhistory-3yrs-400x165.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/plex-dashboard-playhistory-3yrs-150x62.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/plex-dashboard-playhistory-3yrs.jpg 1952w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>We already have more enhancements planned to show full view history, the ability to click through to see which four people played <em>Frozen</em> 97 times, etc. Stay tuned. The Dashboard will evolve, and eventually become sentient. Don&#8217;t say we didn&#8217;t warn you.</p>
<p>You’ll need the latest version of the Plex Media Server (v1.14.1 or newer) and our web app (v3.81.1 or newer; available now in our <a href="https://app.plex.tv/desktop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hosted web app</a> and coming to the bundled server version soon) to see all this deliciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Sleighs and Subtitles</strong><br />
We’ve also been working on improvements for subtitles, another feature that&#8217;s super important to many of you. We&#8217;ve made big improvements to the reliability of <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/subtitles-and-sunsets-big-improvements-little-housekeeping/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">subtitles-on-demand</a>—if you haven&#8217;t tried it recently, give it another shot and let us know how it&#8217;s working for you. We’re also in the process of adding more management features for Plex Pass holders like offset adjustment (available now on Apple TV), as well as manually importing and deleting subs (iOS and Android mobile). Those features will of course be spreading across all our apps.</p>

<p><strong>Enhanced Players</strong><br />
We&#8217;ve touched on this a bit in <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/turning-plex-music-up-to-eleventy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous posts</a>, but we&#8217;ve made some massive improvements to our audio player on mobile platforms, and the video player on iOS and Apple TV. We know the ability to direct play media is important to you, and even though it required a total gutting of the player stack (which is not a small deal), we&#8217;re making great progress. Forget about gapless (<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Babytown%20Frolics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">babytown frolics</a>), have you even heard Sweet Fades, bro? HAVE YOU EVEN DIRECT PLAYED MKV ON YOUR APPLE TV? NO!? Go ahead. We&#8217;ll be here when you get back from having your mind blown. Direct play can make a huge difference for low-powered servers (so much so that we’ve heard <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/an-inconvenient-bug-or-two/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Al Gore</a> might be presenting us with some sort of award in Oslo), but it also makes life much better even on more powerful servers with super fast startup and seeking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! This blog post is dedicated to you, the devoted user. The one who’s been with us since early days, meticulously curating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few terabytes</a> of media goodness. The one who would be happy to see us focus on stability and core functionality, and do a bit of house cleaning along the way.</p>
<p>For years now (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/rob-lowe-literally-ama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">li-ter-ah-ly</a>) you’ve have been asking for a way to get <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/subtitle-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtitles</a> without having to go back to the computer, submit to dubious popup ads, move the subs into place, refresh the media, get distracted by a half-eaten hoagie in the fridge. Sorry, where was I? Oh right, so we’re pleased to announce a feature which makes it so easy to find and enable a subtitle, <em>you don’t even have to leave the couch</em>. We use all sorts of smarts to find you the best matches in all sorts of languages (half of all Plexians are outside the US). <strong>This feature will be rolling out as Plex Pass Preview over the next few days</strong> as we fine tune it on Web Desktop, Xbox One, most LG TVs, Plex Media Player, Android mobile, and Android TV (iOS and Apple TV will follow up shortly).</p>

<em>Android TV</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plex has been around for the better part of a decade, and software has a way of behaving like your garage: You had every intention of keeping it neat and organized, but every nook is somehow filled with Star Wars figurines and Amiibos. So it’s critical to hold the occasional yard sale and get rid of all the accumulated cruft. It’s not an uncommon thing for a software company to do—Apple does it (et tu, OpenGL?), and so does Google (RIP Inbox, Reader).</p>
<p>The Plex ecosystem is quite large, and over the years, we’ve sometimes added things that might have made sense at the time, but didn’t age well. We’ve also been <em>incredibly</em> reluctant to take anything away from people who may be using a given feature. Or kill support for a platform with low usage or other challenges. And while any given case might not be significant, they can add up over a decade to a death by a thousand (paper) cuts. So we set out to do some house-cleaning&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn’t approach the process lightly; we looked over usage numbers and took into account maintenance costs and general customer satisfaction. In some cases, we have plans for a future in which a better replacement shows up. Other things, we’re just stabbing in the chest repeatedly with a wooden stake (and hoping it’s not a zombie). But the philosophy is the same—<em>we want to focus our finite energy on providing awesome functionality that works great and makes the folks who use it happy</em>. Without further ado, here’s the list of things we’re retiring:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Plugins</strong>: This was not a decision taken lightly, as they’ve been around for a long time, and we’ve had good times both writing and using them. But bluntly, hardly anyone uses them (less than 2% of users), the ancient protocol they use is a continued pain for clients to support, and if we were to build the feature again, we’d do it very differently in this day and age. For utility-type functionality, we love standalone apps like <a href="https://tautulli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tautulli</a> and believe this is a better approach. But don’t panic—while the Plugin Directory will soon be gone, you can still manually install plugins for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Watch Later</strong>: There’s a small handful of you who still care about this feature – just enough to form a close-knit support group – and we’re super sorry (really) if this disrupts your daily bookmarking, but the feature is costly for us to maintain, and hard to justify in the long run.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: There is very low usage, and it’s also built atop an antediluvian sync engine, so if you rely on Cloud Sync for your day-to-day, things aren’t pretty. DM us a photo of your Cloud Sync library and today’s newspaper and we’ll buy you a beer? (no, not really).</p>
<p>Lastly, as we’ve previously announced, we’re shuttering our hosted Plex Media Server in the cloud (Plex Cloud) as of November 30. For those of you who relied on the service, please accept our heartfelt apology.</p>
<p>So with all that house-cleaning out of the way, what else have we been doing with our newfound laser focus (and laser-equipped sharks? shh… that’s Phase Two)? A lot of good stuff, actually.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Making Sync Great <del datetime="2018-09-25T15:08:31+00:00">Again</del></strong>: We realize that over the years, our vaunted (and premium) offline sync feature hasn’t always worked as reliably as we would have hoped. We decided to form a Seal Team 6 style group tasked with assassinating as many sync bugs as they could, working with client and server groups, as well as with forum users. The team has already made great headway on fixing some of the most annoying bugs, and you’ll begin to see the fruits of their labor across the next wave of updates.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Making Players Play</strong>: We’ve convened a similar squadron of sauron-eyed swashbucklers to kill bugs in the new Android player engine. Yes, it’s awesome that it Direct Plays everything under the sun, but that doesn’t matter if it randomly stops playing Bachelor in Paradise right as Jenna is about to punch Jordan in the face. Also: that show is everything that is wrong about humans.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>The Sound of Music</strong>: Oh, and clamp down hard on your tuks, because we have some amazing music player improvements in the works. I don’t want to give too much away, but if it rhymes with schmapless, it may be coming to a platform near you. :mic-drop:</p>
<p>In conclusion, we’re working hard to improve our focus, spend time on things that matter the most, remove as many distractions as possible, improve stability of the core product, and launch more kick-ass features. Thanks for your feedback!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we set out to build the best DVR and Live TV platform on the planet, we knew there would be challenges. We built a scheduling engine that reins in the multiverse by considering every possible recording schedule, then picking the best one, much like the <a href="https://www.space.com/40486-hawking-final-paper-physics.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">work of the late, great Stephen Hawking</a>. Tl;dr he found that the <em>Big Bang Theory</em> held strange implications for the multiverse, we say bring on the reruns! We built the smoothest DVR setup experience in the West to get you up and running with a bespoke program guide in no time. We built a sophisticated, multi-layer recording engine to let you tune in and time shift while ensuring your recordings continue without a hitch. You can even skip commercials.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, however, one cry has risen above the rest: &#8220;Can you PLEASE make a grid view?&#8221; (The cry often includes more profanity, but you get the idea.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; we thought. &#8220;Can&#8217;t be done.&#8221; Some of the greatest scientific minds had tried and failed. Then we did it. We think it turned out really nice. Go check it out today in Plex Web!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re coming down from the high of <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/qs3r6w/the-colbert-report-logo-restrictions-for-the-super-bowl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Big Game</em></a> or excited to root for your country during the <a href="https://www.olympic.org/pyeongchang-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Winter Sports</em></a>, you can now watch over-the-air Live TV on <em>even more</em> Plex-supported devices.

<p>Remember those elves we hired to help us get our <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/beginning-look-lot-like-collections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday updates</a>, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-now-virtual-reality-daydream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases</a>, and <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other cool stuff</a> out to you? Oh, we didn’t mention that? Well, now that you’re up to speed, we hired them back at a fraction of their normal cost. They also agreed to be referred to as henchmen, instead of elves, so long as we gave them a shout-out on this blog. <em>Seasonal work is a bitch, but now you get all of these updates:</em></p>

<p>Add another notch on the feature list making Xbox One an excellent choice to play your media using Plex. With live TV, switch between watching <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em> to getting your metaphorical ass handed to you on <em>PLAYERUNKNOWN&#8217;S BATTLEGROUNDS</em>. The elves were even thoughtful enough to add full time shifting so pause/play, rewind, and fast forward while you quest to refill your <span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mountain+dew" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>life force</em></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/roku-live-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live TV is nothing new for Roku</a>, but we’ve upgraded the experience to include a whole slew of features including full time shifting. What else can you expect when you watch Live TV on Roku? Take a look at the player controls and you’ll notice a current time/place marker now appears above the progress bar. There’s also an instant replay option for the times you can’t believe what you just saw. Finally, closed captioning is now available (for both DVR and Live TV) for our friends with hearing impairments. Enjoy your media however you’d like (even if it’s because you don’t want to hear the laugh track!).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ho ho ho! We hope your holiday season has been a wonderful one, filled with spiked eggnog topped with fresh-grated nutmeg; a gentle snow falling outside on a peaceful world; a crackling fire on the hearth, throwing dancing shadows across the room; and a distinct lack of the epic arguments which can only come from having to spend time with visiting family.</p>
<p>Just in case Santa (or whomever his doppelgänger is in your culture) didn’t satiate your desire for goodies, we here at Plex are going to do our best to remediate that (a few days late, technically, but do you know how hard it is to rent flying reindeer this time of year??). If you read the (Plex Pass only) <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/categories/feature-requests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feature Request forum</a>, you’ll know that two of the most popular requests are around improved support for collections (over 17,000 views and exactly 500 comments as of this writing). Well, we’re positively thrilled to serve that up for you today, with a bit of extra special Plex sauce thrown in for good measure. Let’s take a look!</p>
<p>Collections are a way to gather your media together. For example, you might add your zombie movies into a Zombies collection. Items can belong to multiple collections as well, for added flexibility. What we&#8217;ve done is drastically increase the utility of collections. For starters, you can configure exactly how you want collections to behave on a per-library basis; you might want to show collections alongside the items they contain, or collapse the items and just show the collections. Or, if you’re a grinch-type person, you can disable this new behavior altogether. Also: get off my damn lawn.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-6960 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.28-PM-800x311.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.28-PM-800x311.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.28-PM-300x116.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.28-PM-768x298.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.28-PM-640x248.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.28-PM-400x155.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.28-PM-150x58.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.28-PM.jpg 984w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>So now that you’ve edited your movies or TV shows to add one or more Collections Tags (and with the library option enabled), you’ll see collections inline. By default they’ll have a composite poster, but you can set a custom poster and background art by editing the collection entry in the library, just like you would for a regular item.</p>

<p>Clicking on a collection leads you to a beautiful page containing all of the items, which also shows you the date range for the items in the collection. You can edit any collection to order by release date or alphabetically.</p>

<p>At the top level, you can also get a lovely new view of all your collections (and no, I’m not besties with Ridley Scott: that second Blade Runner movie is the “Dangerous Days” documentary on its making).</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-6961 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.39-PM-800x328.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.39-PM-800x328.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.39-PM-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.39-PM-768x315.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.39-PM-1024x420.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.39-PM-1440x590.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.39-PM-640x262.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.39-PM-400x164.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.39-PM-150x62.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-8.39-PM.jpg 1600w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>These collections work much the same way for TV shows, so you can group all zombie-related shows together, or—and this is where it gets fun—you could add TV shows to a Star Wars collection as well. In that case, the two collections from different libraries become linked, and you’ll have access to both on the same page.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-6962 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-9.41-PM-800x493.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-9.41-PM-800x493.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-9.41-PM-300x185.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-9.41-PM-768x473.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-9.41-PM-1024x631.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-9.41-PM-1440x887.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-9.41-PM-640x394.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-9.41-PM-400x247.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-9.41-PM-150x92.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-27-at-9.41-PM.jpg 1600w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Taking it one step further, you can also link artists and albums (which don’t have a top-level collection mode) in this same way, which allows them to show up on show and movie collection pages. For example, let’s take a closer look at my Blade Runner collection, and you can see the soundtracks linked right there next to the movies! You’ll also see these linkages show up on the detail pages for the movies and shows themselves.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy this powerful new collections feature! It’s available today with support on web (only the online <a href="https://app.plex.tv/desktop">plex.tv version</a>, for now), Android, Android TV, iOS, and Apple TV. We’ll be working on bringing support to more Plex apps in the near future! The new functionality requires the latest <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201844613">beta release</a> of <a href="https://www.plex.tv/downloads/">Plex Media Server</a> (if you upgraded early, you might need to restart to activate the feature), and will soon roll out to all users.</p>
<p>Happy New Year, we look forward to spending lots of quality time in 2018 with you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time of year when you realize the only way you can make all of your end of year deadlines is if you crossed paths with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doc Brown</a> (and you conveniently own a DeLorean). Between work deadlines, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/gift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying the right gifts</a>, thinking about New Years’ eve, and sending everyone holiday greetings — it’s easy to want to curl up into the fetal position and hibernate until spring. Well, cross one thing off the list because we’ve made it easier to choose from your never-ending collection of photos for that perfect holiday card. Pick your favorites from that amazing vacation you had this year, or your collection of spontaneous silly license plate wordplay. That’ll show your Aunt Karen you’re a responsible person who has their proverbial sh*t together.</p>

<p>With the favorites option for photos, you can quickly mark your photos with a heart which automatically adds them to a Favorites album, never to be lost among those other basic pumpkin-spiced-latte-esque photos in your library. If you don’t have a Favorites album already, it will automatically be created with your first favorited photo. Looking in the web app? No worries. Whether it’s a single photo or a few, just heart them like your grandma’s facebook post and they will heart you back from their new home.</p>

<p>Combined with some of the other impressive features we released this year, finding and hearting your favorite photos is easier than ever. Don’t forget, you can search or sort through your photos based on album or chronology, with our timeline view feature. Or you can search by automagic tag, based on the subject of the pic you&#8217;re looking for. You can also search for the place where you captured that special memory, and, using geo-tagging, Plex will be there to remember your moments when you’re busy recouping from holiday brain.<br />

The option to favorite photos is free for everyone, but to enjoy the rich Photos experience your captured moments deserve, you’ll need a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Pass</a>. Visit the <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us">support pages</a> to learn more about photo features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year it seems like we’ve had extraordinarily weird news. With many upset that Boaty McBoatface was overturned, Trainy McTrainface has risen like a Phoenix born from the ashes of its predecessor. What else? There were enough Flat Earth truthers to unite for a conference, and DMX just released his long-awaited remix of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. I could go on, but it makes me wonder what I’m being distracted from. What’s the REAL scoop? Between being both entertained and horrified by news this year, it’s as important as ever to stay informed and we’re glad you agree.</p>
<p>Since rolling out Plex News in September, we’ve seen a steady growth in the number of users enjoying it. We appreciate the support you’ve shown us in bringing content to Plex and we’ve been listening to your feedback on how to make it even better.</p>

<p>So what’s new?</p>
<ul>
<li>For starters, we’ve broadened our support. Plex News is available on Android TV, NVIDIA SHIELD, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Roku, Android Mobile, iOS, and on our web app. Now you can enjoy news bites from culinary adventures to natural disasters, and more. As always, we’ll continue to bring support to other platforms.</li>
<li>We’ve pulled a few levers and re-adjusted our highly scientific news content calibrations to feature more content in each news category, less video duplicates of a popular story, and an overall more balanced experience.</li>
<li>Plex News is in good company: we’ve been able to introduce more content with the Associated Press (AP), Reuters, and Local Now. AP boasts coverage from breaking news to investigative reporting in over 100 countries. Similarly, Reuters is the world’s largest international multimedia news provider. Local Now provides <em>hyperlocal</em> weather, traffic, news, and sports reports.</li>
<li>We’ve made News <em>faster</em> (half seconds add up!) and improved overall performance with miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Want more control over what you see? Want to keep your Plex setup unsullied from the dystopian news of 2017? With a new Plex account setting that lets Plex Home admins enable news for their Managed Users or for other accounts to disable News visibility altogether across their apps, you now have more control over what you see.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these updates are now available as soon as you use Plex News. For more information and frequently asked questions, visit <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/sections/115000541373-News" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Support</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that makes Plex magical is the ability to stream <em>all</em> your media to <em>all</em> your devices, no matter where you are in the world &ndash; it&#8217;s pretty amazing, really, until there&#8217;s a disturbance in <em>The Force</em>: maybe your roommate fired up the microwave for yet another Hot Pocket. (The top of the microwave really isn&#8217;t the best spot for your WiFi router&#8230; but I digress.)</p>
<p>Despite all the impressive tech under the hood, let&#8217;s face it, many of us have experienced the dreaded &#8220;buffering&#8221; from time to time. Well, today we&#8217;re here to tell you about a few new features that will ensure your streams keep streaming even as your Hot Pockets are heating.</p>
<p><strong>Auto Quality (Free)</strong></p>
<p>Plex has always let you pick your video streaming quality: full HD while you&#8217;re home on the couch, or slightly-less-than-HD when you&#8217;re parachuting into a Central American jungle to deprive a republic of its banana. The only problem is, picking a quality manually is a bit like playing darts blindfolded: you&#8217;re just as likely to hit the bullseye as the person next to you. Add in a few simultaneous streams, and it gets even worse: now you’re blindfolded, hangry, and someone just put $20 in the jukebox and hit shuffle on Jimmy Buffett.</p>
<p>Enter our <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/mcstreamy-brain-take-world-two-easy-steps/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Streaming Brain</a> robot, who lives in the server and adjusts quality automatically across all streams in the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">pareto efficiency</a>. Tirelessly and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_(character)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">without complaining</a>, while even taking time out to <a href="https://stores.kotisdesign.com/plex/apparel/plex-mcstreamy/17119" rel="noopener" target="_blank">appear on a t-shirt</a>.</p>
<p>The Auto Quality feature worked so well for our Plex Pass users that we decided to enable the feature for everyone. <strong>It&#8217;s available today on web, Android, iOS, Android TV, and Apple TV</strong>. To start using it, simply turn on the &#8220;Automatically Adjust Quality&#8221; option in the Quality settings of the app.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware-Accelerated Streaming (Plex Pass)</strong></p>
<p>Are you sitting on a reasonably modern CPU or GPU? Are you tired of your Plex server heating half your house in the winter? (Note: This last part is not always bad &ndash; it literally might have saved Leo&#8217;s life in Titanic. Or in The Revenant. Why is he always SO DAMN COLD??)</p>
<p>We&#8217;re Team Kate / Bear here, so it brings us great pleasure to introduce hardware-accelerated streaming. This allows Plex Media Server to take advantage of dedicated hardware support to convert video dramatically more efficiently than ever before. This translates into more streams at higher quality (even HD! 4K!), less processor power, and <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/an-inconvenient-bug-or-two/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">happy-ass polar bears</a>. Everyone wins! (except Leo.)</p>
<p><strong>Hardware-accelerated streaming is available today for <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plex Pass</a> subscribers</strong>. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux with modern Intel processors that support Intel Quick Sync. Some AMD GPUs and NVIDIA GPUs are also supported on Windows and Mac.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate how hard this streaming stuff really is, we recruited Barkley and a garden-variety hose. In this visual metaphor, the water is your episode of The Bachelorette: All that is pure and good in this world. This is the stream upon which Plex feeds. Barkley is the unknown, striking down upon your stream with great vengeance and furious anger. And the grass? Well, the grass represents the plight of the proletariat. Everyone pisses on them. Don&#8217;t be the grass.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tl;dr</a> &ndash; Update your Plex Media Server to experience even smoother streaming using Auto Quality and Hardware-Accelerated Streaming.</p>
