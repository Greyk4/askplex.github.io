@frank if your firetv is updated to FireOS 5 then Dobly 5.1 (AC3) should work as long as the device it is connected to can output AC3. If you need help the best place to ask is in or forums at https://forums.plex.tv]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-available-amazons-fire-tv/#comment-52957&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt;.

@Nick - Check the devices audio output settings, in the OS, Settings &#062; Display &#038; Sounds &#062; Audio &#062; Dolby Digital Output &#062; Dolby Digital Plus: OFF
      - or if that doesn’t work, try disabling “AC3” and “EAC3” in our app

it sounds like you TV is telling the device it can handle 5.1 (e)AC3 but  it actually can&#039;t. If you still have troubles please post some details in out support forums]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi
I don&#039;t know if this is the right place to post this.

I&#039;ve just bought the fire tv stick and added the plex app but when I play a movie ripped with 5.1 audio I do get some sound but no speech as if its not playing what would be the centre speaker.

I&#039;m only using the tv speakers for the tv stick so only need it to play back in 2.0 audio.

Is there a way to fix this? I can&#039;t see anything in settings.

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@steve. Had the same issue. App will work in freetime if you have a plex pass. Bought a lifetime yesterday and signed into freetime. Even added a profile that makes it so she can only watch the kids show I think she is old enough for. Works great now.]]></description>

@Steve: If your daughter is using Amazon&#039;s &quot;FreeTime&quot; restricted profile, those are prevented from accessing in-app purchase information (that&#039;s an Amazon restriction; not ours). That means that the Plex for Android app would be prevented from checking whether it&#039;s been activated or not.]]></description>

@Lane: Signing in to the app is not required for use on the Amazon Fire TV, so not sure how you&#039;d be seeing that. Recommend you start by uninstalling the app, rebooting the device, and installing fresh. If you still have issues, please visit our support forums.]]></description>
