					<description><![CDATA[I am so happy about the ability to have my own pre-roll clip. When I first heard this was going to be added last year, I kind of went nuts creating some cool opener videos. Sadly I have to choose just one. Will it be in the cards to add multiple pre-roll videos and have the system randomly select one? Or to set a pre-roll video for a specific Genre?  I would love to have my dark and creepy opener play before any horror movies. :)   Just a thought/request.]]></description>

@Douglas  you need to enable trailers in your server and how many trailers to play before a movie in the app you are using to cast to chromecast. https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/202920803  https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/202934883]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just signed up for Plex Pass and took me like 30 seconds to fall in love with Cinema Trailers!!!  Feature request though... some sort of Icon in the corner of the screen (or some other method) to indicate &quot;this is a movie in YOUR library.&quot;  Sometimes it can be easy to forget everything you&#039;ve put into your library and it would be great when you can see -- &quot;Hey!  I&#039;ve got that!&quot; when the trailer comes on.]]></description>

@JacobÂ ~ Yep, you need to get trailers and put them alongside the movies, as explained here ~ Look for &quot;Local Extras&quot; in https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200220677]]></description>

@Alex ~ With a Plex Pass, you can get Extras automatically for each item, without any need to put local files anywhere (just refresh your library). You could probably write your own extras agent as well (check the forums, others may have done it already). See https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/202934883 for more details.]]></description>
