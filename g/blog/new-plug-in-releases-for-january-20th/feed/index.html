					<description><![CDATA[Religion and Porn should both be rated NC-17. Children don&#039;t need to see or hear any of that nonsense until their brains are capable of clear thinking. They get a healthy dose of fantasy from everywhere else, without needing to  throw in Porn and Religeon into the mix.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry but you&#039;d rather let your kids watch porn than listen to someone teach them things like honor your parents, do not murder or similar things like that?  If that is what no religion and lots of porn does to you then my vote is to keep it out.  Everything has its problems including religion but do you really need another way to spank off in your living room?  Come on, seriously; you are upset over a little religious app but no one peeps about them letting the Canadians in!]]></description>

@Dave, @Liam and others: As soon as we have parental rating system in place, we&#039;ll definitely reconsider adult content, even in the main app store. Trust me, I understand where you&#039;re coming from :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I third the pr0n before religious content.

If there is any kind of content that is unsuitable for children, it&#039;s religious material.

Personally, I&#039;d much rather find my kids watching porn (within reason) than the narrow-minded vitriol spewed by some of these religious types.

I wish someone could explain to me why it&#039;s deemed perfectly acceptable to show immoral and illegal acts (stealing, killing etc.) but not to show the most natural and normal thing in the world (sex).]]></description>
