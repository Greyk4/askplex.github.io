										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! This blog post is dedicated to you, the devoted user. The one who’s been with us since early days, meticulously curating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few terabytes</a> of media goodness. The one who would be happy to see us focus on stability and core functionality, and do a bit of house cleaning along the way.</p>
<p>For years now (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/rob-lowe-literally-ama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">li-ter-ah-ly</a>) you’ve have been asking for a way to get <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/subtitle-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtitles</a> without having to go back to the computer, submit to dubious popup ads, move the subs into place, refresh the media, get distracted by a half-eaten hoagie in the fridge. Sorry, where was I? Oh right, so we’re pleased to announce a feature which makes it so easy to find and enable a subtitle, <em>you don’t even have to leave the couch</em>. We use all sorts of smarts to find you the best matches in all sorts of languages (half of all Plexians are outside the US). <strong>This feature will be rolling out as Plex Pass Preview over the next few days</strong> as we fine tune it on Web Desktop, Xbox One, most LG TVs, Plex Media Player, Android mobile, and Android TV (iOS and Apple TV will follow up shortly).</p>

<em>Android TV</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plex has been around for the better part of a decade, and software has a way of behaving like your garage: You had every intention of keeping it neat and organized, but every nook is somehow filled with Star Wars figurines and Amiibos. So it’s critical to hold the occasional yard sale and get rid of all the accumulated cruft. It’s not an uncommon thing for a software company to do—Apple does it (et tu, OpenGL?), and so does Google (RIP Inbox, Reader).</p>
<p>The Plex ecosystem is quite large, and over the years, we’ve sometimes added things that might have made sense at the time, but didn’t age well. We’ve also been <em>incredibly</em> reluctant to take anything away from people who may be using a given feature. Or kill support for a platform with low usage or other challenges. And while any given case might not be significant, they can add up over a decade to a death by a thousand (paper) cuts. So we set out to do some house-cleaning&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn’t approach the process lightly; we looked over usage numbers and took into account maintenance costs and general customer satisfaction. In some cases, we have plans for a future in which a better replacement shows up. Other things, we’re just stabbing in the chest repeatedly with a wooden stake (and hoping it’s not a zombie). But the philosophy is the same—<em>we want to focus our finite energy on providing awesome functionality that works great and makes the folks who use it happy</em>. Without further ado, here’s the list of things we’re retiring:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Plugins</strong>: This was not a decision taken lightly, as they’ve been around for a long time, and we’ve had good times both writing and using them. But bluntly, hardly anyone uses them (less than 2% of users), the ancient protocol they use is a continued pain for clients to support, and if we were to build the feature again, we’d do it very differently in this day and age. For utility-type functionality, we love standalone apps like <a href="https://tautulli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tautulli</a> and believe this is a better approach. But don’t panic—while the Plugin Directory will soon be gone, you can still manually install plugins for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Watch Later</strong>: There’s a small handful of you who still care about this feature – just enough to form a close-knit support group – and we’re super sorry (really) if this disrupts your daily bookmarking, but the feature is costly for us to maintain, and hard to justify in the long run.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: There is very low usage, and it’s also built atop an antediluvian sync engine, so if you rely on Cloud Sync for your day-to-day, things aren’t pretty. DM us a photo of your Cloud Sync library and today’s newspaper and we’ll buy you a beer? (no, not really).</p>
<p>Lastly, as we’ve previously announced, we’re shuttering our hosted Plex Media Server in the cloud (Plex Cloud) as of November 30. For those of you who relied on the service, please accept our heartfelt apology.</p>
<p>So with all that house-cleaning out of the way, what else have we been doing with our newfound laser focus (and laser-equipped sharks? shh… that’s Phase Two)? A lot of good stuff, actually.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Making Sync Great <del datetime="2018-09-25T15:08:31+00:00">Again</del></strong>: We realize that over the years, our vaunted (and premium) offline sync feature hasn’t always worked as reliably as we would have hoped. We decided to form a Seal Team 6 style group tasked with assassinating as many sync bugs as they could, working with client and server groups, as well as with forum users. The team has already made great headway on fixing some of the most annoying bugs, and you’ll begin to see the fruits of their labor across the next wave of updates.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Making Players Play</strong>: We’ve convened a similar squadron of sauron-eyed swashbucklers to kill bugs in the new Android player engine. Yes, it’s awesome that it Direct Plays everything under the sun, but that doesn’t matter if it randomly stops playing Bachelor in Paradise right as Jenna is about to punch Jordan in the face. Also: that show is everything that is wrong about humans.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>The Sound of Music</strong>: Oh, and clamp down hard on your tuks, because we have some amazing music player improvements in the works. I don’t want to give too much away, but if it rhymes with schmapless, it may be coming to a platform near you. :mic-drop:</p>
<p>In conclusion, we’re working hard to improve our focus, spend time on things that matter the most, remove as many distractions as possible, improve stability of the core product, and launch more kick-ass features. Thanks for your feedback!</p>

<p>Remember those elves we hired to help us get our <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/beginning-look-lot-like-collections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday updates</a>, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-now-virtual-reality-daydream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases</a>, and <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other cool stuff</a> out to you? Oh, we didn’t mention that? Well, now that you’re up to speed, we hired them back at a fraction of their normal cost. They also agreed to be referred to as henchmen, instead of elves, so long as we gave them a shout-out on this blog. <em>Seasonal work is a bitch, but now you get all of these updates:</em></p>

<p>Add another notch on the feature list making Xbox One an excellent choice to play your media using Plex. With live TV, switch between watching <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em> to getting your metaphorical ass handed to you on <em>PLAYERUNKNOWN&#8217;S BATTLEGROUNDS</em>.

<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/roku-live-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live TV is nothing new for Roku</a>, but we’ve upgraded the experience to include a whole slew of features including full time shifting. What else can you expect when you watch Live TV on Roku? Take a look at the player controls and you’ll notice a current time/place marker now appears above the progress bar. There’s also an instant replay option for the times you can’t believe what you just saw. Finally, closed captioning is now available (for both DVR and Live TV) for our friends with hearing impairments. Enjoy your media however you’d like (even if it’s because you don’t want to hear the laugh track!).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the Xbox One debuted (almost four years ago!) it brought a few really innovative ideas to the home media world: lovely little clusters of media tailored to your interests, horizontally-scrolling lists as far as the eye could see, and the ability to <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/09/xbox-pizza-hut_n_4570898.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order a pizza</a> without moving a muscle. Needless to say we were quick to <s>steal</s> adapt some of the more compelling ideas for our own devices. (We even reached out to some of <a href="http://usedtobeapizzahut.blogspot.com/">these guys</a>, but they didn’t seem too interested, <em>for some reason&#8230;</em>).</p>
<p>A lot has happened since the early days. The Xbox team has been busy with their own redesigned dashboard and a new console, and it turns out we&#8217;ve been doing some innovating of our own: we&#8217;ve got a brand new, media-centric user interface that reflects our love for gorgeous metadata (posters! artwork!) as well as our passion for media browsing efficiency, and we&#8217;re bringing it to the Xbox One! We&#8217;ve got some great media discovery features where they make sense, and sensible, efficient grids everywhere else. Alas, we don&#8217;t have the ability to order a <em>Meat Lovers&#8217; with Extra Meat</em>, but we think it&#8217;s pretty tasty just the same. (And let&#8217;s be honest, these days true connoisseurs order their pizza with their voice assistant of choice.) Feast your eyes on the new goodness:</p>

<p>While we were sexying things up, we also threw in a few other improvements under the metaphorical hood:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mixed Photo/Video Libraries</strong><br />
Now, not only can you view all the unforgettable moments captured in your vacation photos, but you can watch the videos you took during the trip, too. All within the same library!</li>
<li><strong>Alexa Compatibility</strong><br />
Compatibility with Alexa means you can freely lose the remote into the deep abyss of couch cushions with wild abandon; just talk to her, already!</li>
<li><strong>Better Subtitle Compatibility</strong><br />
The app can now display many subtitle formats without using additional server resources. Enjoy faster playback and less whirring!</li>
<li><strong>Xbox Gamertags</strong><br />
Not sure you want everyone to know how long you&#8217;ve been playing <a href="http://www.goat-simulator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goat Simulator</a>? For the internet sleuths in your life, Plex accounts are no longer tied to your Xbox gamertags. There&#8217;s no need to link accounts, and you can enjoy your newfound freedom!</li>
</ul>

<p>This update is free for everyone using Plex on Xbox One, but don&#8217;t fret! We&#8217;re always working to improve all of our apps. The update will roll out automatically over the next few days, but If you&#8217;re too excited to wait, you can search for the &#8220;Plex for Xbox One&#8221; app in the Microsoft Store to manually install.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Plexians! We just thought we’d take a quick break from all the hard work and let you know what we’ve been up to for the last few weeks. We’ll highlight the most awesome new features, releases, and news from across our ecosystem.</p>
<p>First stop, the Roku. They’re small, cute, and dependable. Much like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Tribbles">tribble</a>, but much less trouble.</p>
<ul>
<li>We added Rotten Tomato movie ratings. (Is it bad that I almost accidentally <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/quayle3.htm">pulled a Dan Quayle</a>?)</li>
<li>One of our most popular features, TV theme music, is back in the new app.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/27134/plex-for-roku#latest)">giant list</a> of fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next stop, iOS. I’ll refrain from making a comment about hipster facial hair, even though I use an iOS device and currently have hipster facial hair.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve added a lovely “post-play” screen which encourages you to keep watching until way past your bedtime.
<div class="clearfix" style="padding-top: 20px"><img class="alignleft size-blog wp-image-2847" style="max-width: 375px" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/post-play.jpg" alt="post-play" /></div>
</li>
<li>We’ve added Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews.
<div class="clearfix" style="padding-top: 20px"><img class="alignleft size-blog wp-image-2844" style="max-width: 375px" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ios-reviews.jpg" alt="ios-reviews" /></div>
</li>
<li>You can now stream ALAC music files to your devices. Please only listen via headphones connected to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bravo-Audio-V1-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B00A2QKTLW/">tube headphone amp</a> for your device.</li>
<li>You can now change your remote audio quality setting, so when you’ve left your tube amp at home and have a crappy 3G signal, you can still enjoy your music.</li>
<li>A brand new first run experience. If you’re new to Plex, we do a much better job of getting you up to speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next stop, Android and Android TV. I just installed an <a href="https://shield.nvidia.com">Nvidia Shield</a> as my primary living room player, and I have to say, I love it. We’ve added the ability to render embedded PGS/VobSub subtitles inside MKVs. This means no transcoding, no burning, just sweet fast Direct Play (this is on top of the number of other subtitle formats we render in the app).</p>
<p>Also great news, we have <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1191090/#Comment_1191090">a massive update</a> for the Xbox One app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plex Home support!</li>
<li>Music lyrics!</li>
<li>Ability to create and edit playlists.</li>
<li>Much more media direct played (HEVC/FLAC/ALAC/WAV).</li>
<li>Stepping through videos will use chapter timestamps if they exist.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-2850" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/192.168.1.92_Image_1.png" alt="192.168.1.92_Image_1" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-2851" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/192.168.1.92_Image_2.png" alt="192.168.1.92_Image_2" /></p>
<p>Our Smart TV app (PS3, PS4, and many other TVs) also got a large update:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can stream from a mobile server (e.g. iOS). How cool is that?</li>
<li>You can stream from Cloud Sync servers.</li>
<li>You can (finally!) play video and photo playlists.</li>
<li>Last, but not least, a clock!
<div class="clearfix" style="padding-top: 20px"><img class="alignleft size-blog wp-image-2848" style="max-width: 375px" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/clock.jpg" alt="clock" /></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we have some special news for Samsung lovers: our official new smart TV app (as seen on LG, VIZIO and others) will be shipping on all 2016 Samsung smart TVs that support the Tizen operating system! Rollouts will begin with their higher end models, but Plex will be included on all 2016 models that support Tizen apps.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-blog wp-image-2854" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-31-at-2.44.21-PM.png" alt="Plex for Samsung smart TV" /></p>
<p>With that quick update, we bid you a fond adieu, and we’ll be back with you shortly!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, we have some great news today. Finally, FINALLY, we have a massive Xbox One update for you. Seriously, who knew that getting an update into the store was harder than killing ice zombies by beating them over the head with an original Xbox console?</p>
<p>We’ll keep this short and sweet, so you can spend your time enjoying the update, so here’s what’s new:</p>
<p><strong>Music Support</strong> Finally, your Xbox One will sing. I mean, not literally, like you in the shower this morning, but close enough. Play your music, even in snapped mode or in the background on the home screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/4.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2597" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/4-800x435.png" alt="4" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Playlists</strong>: Access all your music and video playlists. Shuffle your favorite artist, or just binge watch an entire season of Futurama while eating pizza. We won’t judge, but your Kinect might.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/192.168.0.116_image_8.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2598" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/192.168.0.116_image_8-800x450.png" alt="192.168.0.116_image_8" /></a></p>
<p><strong>SmartGlass support</strong>: Control and see what&#8217;s currently playing from your favorite SmartGlass-capable device. (No, you glasshole, this has nothing to do with you.)</p>
<p><strong>Cinema Trailers &amp; Extras</strong>: Watch movies as God intended, assuming God likes $10 popcorn and sticky floors. Trailers before your movies! Extras, including music videos, are all there for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/192.168.0.116_image_6.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2599" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/192.168.0.116_image_6-800x450.png" alt="192.168.0.116_image_6" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Direct Play for MKV</strong>: Most MKV video files no longer need to be converted for playback. Wowsers! Give your server a break, and enjoy super fast seeks using the Xbox video player’s native MKV support.</p>
<p><strong>Navigation Shortcuts</strong>: New key bindings to directly start playing something when browsing (X) or flip between TV episodes (L/R bumpers).</p>
<p>And, of course, lots of other fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Best of all, since this release took so long, we’ve been hard at work on the <em>next</em> release, which is sort of like having a time machine, if you tilt your head just so or drink way too much Cabernet. Basically it means we’ll have good news for you in the near future about even more awesome stuff for the Xbox One app.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll leave you with a photo of Barkley hunting for dinner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve been around for a while, you know how much we love bringing the awesome Plex experience to a brand new platform. Whether that means working hard to run on existing devices like the <a href="http://www.roku.com/channels/#!details/13535/plex">Roku</a>, or working more closely with a partner like Google to bring you a world class <a href="https://blog.plex.tv/2014/06/25/plex-brand-new-android-tv/">Android TV</a> app, we&#8217;re always looking for new and cool ways to make sure you can access your media wherever you are on your favorite device. Well today, we&#8217;re super excited to announce that Plex is coming to not one, but <em>two</em> new platforms: the <strong>Xbox One and Xbox 360</strong>!</p>
<p>Each of these apps has been crafted to feel right at home on the Xbox, complete with voice and gesture control, and you are going to love them. They&#8217;ll be available for free for Plex Pass members on Tuesday Oct 7th for the Xbox One, and shortly after that for the Xbox 360. (Don’t have a console? We thought of everything: we’ll be giving an Xbox One away on our social media channels, so stay tuned.) If you don’t have a Plex Pass, you’ll be able to purchase the apps with a one-time fee after the Plex Pass preview period. Also, we focused on video for this initial release; rest easy knowing we’re working hard on adding photo and music support, but we didn’t want to wait to get it into your hands!</p>
<p>This is huge, not only because it&#8217;s the first time Plex will run natively on a gaming console, and not just because there are over 80 <em>million</em> Xboxes out in the wild (it turns out there are a <em>lot </em>of Xbox fans out there!). We&#8217;ve also taken this opportunity to reimagine the experience of using Plex on a TV.  Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>Home Screen</strong>: We’ve completely redesigned the home screen, as you can see below. We display content from a single server at a time now, so whether you’re accessing your own server or a shared server, you’ll have the same great view. We also have a new Continue Watching area, and we’ve split up the Recently Added area by media type and made it even smarter.</p>
<p><img title="NewImage.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NewImage.png" alt="NewImage" border="0" /></p>
<p><img title="xbox360-home-screen-complete.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/xbox360-home-screen-complete.png" alt="Xbox360 home screen complete" border="0" /></p>
<p><strong>Movie Libraries</strong>: You can always browse through your entire collection, but we’ve added some fun ways of bubbling up content from your library in new and dynamic ways, based upon your viewing habits and taste. When you’re viewing details for a movie, you also have lots of options to explore as well. If you haven’t seen Evil Dead 2, you really should, it’s a classic (especially the “hand” scene). And wow, I didn’t realize Sam Raimi also did Spiderman.</p>
<p><img title="2014-10-05 at 11.13 AM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014-10-05-at-11.13-AM.png" alt="2014 10 05 at 11 13 AM" border="0" /></p>
<p><img title="2014-10-05 at 1.09 PM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014-10-05-at-1.09-PM.png" alt="2014 10 05 at 1 09 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p><img title="2014-10-05 at 11.16 AM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014-10-05-at-11.16-AM.png" alt="2014 10 05 at 11 16 AM" border="0" /></p>
<p><strong>TV Libraries</strong>: We’ve also added a few fun new ways to explore TV content, including Start Watching (shows you haven’t started watching yet), and Rediscover (shows you started watching and may have forgotten about). We don&#8217;t yet have a special category for “TV Shows that horrified your wife so badly you only got halfway through the very first episode”, but Dexter would definitely be in there.</p>
<p><img title="2014-10-05 at 11.28 AM.png" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014-10-05-at-11.28-AM.png" alt="2014 10 05 at 11 28 AM" border="0" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to install the latest Plex Pass preview release of the server (v0.9.10.3), available today, which includes support for these new apps, and a few other great new things. For example, we’ve finally added support for translating all the text in the media server to languages other than English. If you’d like to help us with the translations, head <a href="http://www.getlocalization.com/PlexMediaServer/">over here</a> and lend a hand! Full details about the new release are available in the usual place, and you can download it <a href="http://plex.tv/downloads?channel=plexpass">right here</a>.</p>
<p>Well, since this is officially two releases, it seems only fair to get two photos of Barkley.</p>
<p><img title="IMG_0140.JPG" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_0140.jpg" alt="IMG 0140" border="0" /></p>
<p><img title="IMG_0165.JPG" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_0165.jpg" alt="IMG 0165" border="0" /></p>
<p>Some frequently asked questions in the comments. If you ask one of these questions without reading this, we will sic Barkley on you, although you’ll probably just end up getting drooled on.</p>
<p><strong>Xbox says I need Plex Media Server version 0.9.10.3. I checked for updates and I have the latest? </strong>You need a preview release of the media server, please see <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201844613-Early-Access-Preview-Releases">this page</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Will the app always need a server?</strong> Yes, the apps will always require a separate server.  There are no plans to build this capability into the Xbox apps themselves.</p>
<p><strong>The app runs, but it can’t find my server. Help?</strong> The server needs to be signed into plex.tv. Also, make sure your server and the Xbox are on the same local network (beware separate wireless/wired networks with NAT). If you just did an upgrade, and it’s still complaining about the server version, sign out and in of the Plex app. </p>
<p><strong>Does the app support MKV? DTS? If not, why not?</strong> Microsoft just announced support for MKV for their October release, so it’s a brand new feature. We’re working with them to hopefully bring this support in a future update. At present, there is no support for 3rd party applications to play DTS.</p>
<p><strong>How long is the Plex Pass preview period?</strong> There is no fixed timeframe; it continues while we fix reported issues, add some more features, and generally get it all shiny and sparkling.</p>
<p><strong>When will the XB360 app be available?</strong> There’s no fixed date, it’s working through a process which takes a variable amount of time, and as soon as it’s in the store, we’ll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>Will the apps require Xbox Live Gold?</strong> As per <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2014/05/xbox-delivering-more-choices">this article</a>, Microsoft is making entertainment and streaming apps available to everyone on the Xbox One and 360.</p>
<p><strong>Where are my music, photos, and channels?</strong> As mentioned in the post above, this initial release only has support for video. We’re working hard to add photo and music support!</p>
<p><strong>What about multiple users inside a house?</strong> Right now any account using the app requires a Plex Pass. We’re working to improve that situation.</p>
<p><strong>Will the app work with a NAS?</strong> It’ll run perfectly on a NAS which supports transcoding or remuxing. You can check <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/plexapp.com/spreadsheets/d/1MfYoJkiwSqCXg8cm5-Ac4oOLPRtCkgUxU0jdj3tmMPc/edit#gid=314388488">our list</a>. Otherwise, your media needs to be in a format which is directly playable, such as MP4.</p>
<p><strong>What about feature X?</strong> We strive for feature parity across all our apps, so if you don’t see a feature right now (e.g. Trailers), know we’ll be bringing it as soon as we can.</p>
