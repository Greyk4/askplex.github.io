@Richard: That typically happens if your Samsung device is running an older firmware that doesn&#039;t support TLS connections. You ought to just need to have the device check for updated firmware.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[after updating to v 2.005 (I believe) on my Samsung TV, the Plex app is not working anymore!  It begins by asking me to log onto a Plex website to enter the displayed pin number, however, there is no pin number displayed!  Yes my server is up and running, and yes, my network is operating fine, and yes the previous version of Plex was operating fine as well.  Please help!]]></description>

@Shoaib: Channel management (installation, removal, etc.) is handled in our web app, but you can access supported channels that you&#039;ve installed in the various Plex apps. If you&#039;re having issues, we recommend visiting our support forum: https://forums.plex.tv/categories/samsung-smart-hub]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I am new to plex. I created a plex account on their website and plex server on my computer. Then I installed Plex on my Samsung 46&quot; HD 3D Smart Tv. It asked to enter the 4 digit pin on the website which I did and it was verified.
But I don&#039;t understand how to install channels in the Plex app on my Samsung Tv? I can easily add channels on the Plex app/server on my computer.

Thanks in advance]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bought my Samsung 65 inch UHD about three months ago. Chose it because it had the best image quality. I converted from a 50inch Plasma, so it will take for ever to acclimatise to a screen of grey clouds instead of flat black, trade-offs, power saving and heat reduction definitely major positives.

The PLEX app was a major surprise worked well, looked amazing and played mkv files.

I no longer need a &quot;Media Portal&quot; based PC connected to the TV. The PC/Server is now hidden in another room. The server gets quite busy when transcoding a couple of streams, now no more heat or noise in the media room which is windowless with air-con, major bonus.

I have since replaced my two WDTV boxes with Roku boxes running PLEX and have PLEX on everything else [5 PC&#039;s 2 Android phones], truly amazing app!

There are several small annoyances that could be changed but everything works so well they&#039;re no big deal:
*constant logins to activate my account (possibly because I use a VPN)
*database optimisation should be automatic or scheduled, with a backup option
*option to have TV boot to PLEX on startup
*recently added episodes list individually, not by season as on Roku
*subtitles take some fiddling

Overall 9 out of 10]]></description>
