										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Um. Suffice it to say that a lot has happened since we last blogged a few months back. This may not be your typical Plex blog post, but it’ll probably be one of the least crazy things to happen today. </p>
<p>Quite a few of you have reached out to share how much Plex has helped over the past weeks and how it fits in to your shelter-in-place regimen, whether it’s keeping kids from tearing each other’s hair out, or keeping family and friends fed with a steady stream of media to pass the time. To be clear, we’re on the far fringes of being able to make a meaningful contribution to returning things to normal. While we’re not working on the cure*, we’re incredibly honored to know that we’re working on something that may make the mitigation a little more tolerable for all of you. It gives us a renewed sense of purpose. We won’t let you down.</p>
<h3>28 <del>Days</del> <del>Hours</del> Minutes Later</h3>
<p>This isn’t a Hands Across America sort of post—no false platitudes. For us, the reason we built Plex was that we always loved getting lost in stories. Movies and TV shows, documentaries and anime, old favorites as well as wild new experiences. To share a personal guilty pleasure, in times like this we’re comforted by watching really bad, really stupid, “c’mon you can’t be seriously watching that” comedies. Other people curl up with a good zombie movie. Others binge all the reality shows that seemed so trite before but now just might be able to deliver a much-needed moment of zen. Whatever your go-to jam is, we hope you get a chance to take a break every now and again. Okay! Now on to the rest of our blog.</p>
<h3>First, if you’re an educator quickly adapting to online classes, Plex might be able to help<br />
</h3>
<p>To be clear, this is a bit of a stretch for us as we’re a relatively small company, but we have a platform that might be of value to educators out there. We are aware of a number of schools (and hospitals, churches, and even a submarine!) that have used Plex to stream licensed and teacher-generated videos in classrooms. We’ve recently helped a San Francisco Bay Area school that suddenly needed to figure out how to distribute this content remotely via tablets and web browsers. We were able to donate the costs associated with the remote software, as well as provide early access to a new feature we’re working on, single item sharing, so teachers can now share their playlists or specific content directly with their classes. If you’re an educational institution that may benefit from using Plex, email us details at <a href="mailto:edu@plex.tv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">edu@plex.tv</a> so we can understand what you are looking to do, assess the demand, and see how we might be able to help. </p>
<h3>A few tips on Remote Working, aka how to have a conference call in your kid’s closet</h3>
<p>From day one, we’ve been a completely remote company, working out the kinks of “working in your bedroom / dining room / garage / (hopefully sleeping) baby’s nursery” for the last 10 years. We’re spread across six different continents, so we’re well-versed in the tradeoffs of which time zone gets the short end of the stick to get up at 5 AM to make that conference call (sorry Team Australia). So at Plex, we’re all used to the hassle of video communication and with the paradise and the disaster that comes with working at home. For many of you, welcome to the new normal. If you’re new to the game, here’s <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/work-from-home?utm_source=plex&#038;utm_medium=plex-blog&#038;utm_campaign=plex-blog-this-is-fine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a great post with 47 specific WFH hacks</a> as well as a recent Forbes post (by our very own Keith Valory) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/03/25/communication-and-collaboration-the-keys-to-successful-remote-work/#6bba94212a0b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on setting up your business for WFH</a>.</p>
<h3>Okay, another thing. For the next 3 months, Live TV will be free—no Plex Pass required</h3>
<p>If you have an HD antenna and tuner, then now you can stream your free live TV to all your devices without Plex Pass through the end of June (DVR and other premium features still require a Plex Pass). And if you don’t, we got some of our hardware partners to offer them to Plex users <a href="https://www.plex.tv/ad/community-love-plex-fam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at a discount for a limited time</a>. You can stream reruns, new shows (treasure them!), news, or kids programming. Stream it all around your home or while you’re away. Maybe it will help educate, entertain, enlighten, or another e-starting-word. <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/live-tv-over-the-air-functionality-free-for-the-next-3-months/561368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Get the details here</a>. We’ve been working especially hard to fix lots of issues with Live TV based on thoughtful feedback from the community. Stay tuned for more details on that soon.<br />

<h3>(*) Other ways to help</h3>
<p>We’ll leave it to others more knowledgeable in your local communities and countries on how best to donate and support each other financially and emotionally. We do know many of you probably have some spare CPU and GPU cycles lying around, though, so we’d like to highlight an opportunity to put them to work with <a href="https://foldingathome.org/covid19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">folding@home</a> (feel free to join “<a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/249802" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Team Plex</a>” #249802 if you don’t already have a team). As they say, “Each simulation you run is like buying a lottery ticket. The more tickets we buy, the better our chances of hitting the jackpot.” So by all means, let’s go make some more lottery tickets.</p>
<h3>And if you’ve read this far, yes, we do have an Official Unofficial Plex Coloring Book for you to download</h3>
<p>The least we can do (and we mean that quite literally) is make a Plex coloring book. (Thanks again Team Australia!) After all the movies have been watched, board games have been played, podcasts have been, um, podded, and you get to that point of maximum boredom, we present to you the official unofficial Plex coloring book. Take your frustration out in colored pencil form. Print it out. Doodle. Draw. Or share your kid’s (or your) best efforts on Facebook or Instagram for a chance to earn some Plex swag. <a href="https://assets.plex.tv/marketing/coloring-book/plex-coloring-book-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.<br />

<h3>Togethertude</h3>
<p>So in closing, during this period of uncertainty, hopefully you’ve got some family with you, some friends, or at least on-screen companions reaching out from their own couches, a town, or a country over. Just know we’ll be joining you, finding a moment of escape and perhaps even the briefest but most delicious slice of joy. Stay safe out there (or more likely, in there). We’re here for you.</p>
<p>So what are your hacks for surviving indoors in this unusual new time? Let us know in the comments down below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time of year when you realize the only way you can make all of your end of year deadlines is if you crossed paths with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doc Brown</a> (and you conveniently own a DeLorean). Between work deadlines, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/gift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying the right gifts</a>, thinking about New Years’ eve, and sending everyone holiday greetings — it’s easy to want to curl up into the fetal position and hibernate until spring. Well, cross one thing off the list because we’ve made it easier to choose from your never-ending collection of photos for that perfect holiday card. Pick your favorites from that amazing vacation you had this year, or your collection of spontaneous silly license plate wordplay. That’ll show your Aunt Karen you’re a responsible person who has their proverbial sh*t together.</p>

<p>With the favorites option for photos, you can quickly mark your photos with a heart which automatically adds them to a Favorites album, never to be lost among those other basic pumpkin-spiced-latte-esque photos in your library. If you don’t have a Favorites album already, it will automatically be created with your first favorited photo. Looking in the web app? No worries. Whether it’s a single photo or a few, just heart them like your grandma’s facebook post and they will heart you back from their new home.</p>

<p>Combined with some of the other impressive features we released this year, finding and hearting your favorite photos is easier than ever. Don’t forget, you can search or sort through your photos based on album or chronology, with our timeline view feature. Or you can search by automagic tag, based on the subject of the pic you&#8217;re looking for. You can also search for the place where you captured that special memory, and, using geo-tagging, Plex will be there to remember your moments when you’re busy recouping from holiday brain.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we’ve advanced to the point where every episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Mirror</a> (or for those more vintage, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052520/?ref_=nv_sr_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilight Zone</a>) feels hauntingly close to home, I like to reminisce about a time when I didn’t have a smartphone affixed to my hand. It used to be that any device with the ability to take photos required you to stay impossibly still for any trace of clarity. Now I can take a gratuitously dull photo, add a filter, maybe even a rainbow vomiting effect, and <i>presto</i>! Instant likes. After I’ve taken the shot, I can forget the moment even happened.</p>
<p>Which makes me wonder, how often do we look at our own photos and videos? Having a media-capturing powerhouse that fits in your pocket makes it too easy to hoard photos and videos. This is where Plex can help. With features for <em>Photos and Videos</em> on <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Pass</a>, you can store, tag, and sort your beautiful photos and videos; view them on a map AND a myriad of devices. Our beloved customers already trust us with billions (yes billions!!!) of their photos.<br />

We recently unveiled <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/234976627-Auto-Tagging-of-Photos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatic image tagging</a>, which uses object and scene recognition, deep neural networks, and droids* to help organize your photos. <em>Now,</em> we’re excited to debut what we’re calling <i>Places.</i> This feature allows you to see the location where each photo was taken, as long as it was captured with a GPS-enabled device. Where were you when the solar eclipse happened? Places can answer that. Your photos and videos are now discoverable by location. Even better, based on what’s nearby, you’re given suggestions on related photos and albums.</p>
<p>&#8230;<i>But don’t worry</i>, since your photos are locally hosted, you are in control of your most private moments, and only you can see the locations. As long as that device is iOS, Android, Android TV, Apple TV, and Plex Web app &#8212; we&#8217;re working on the rest! Local hosting also means that for those with an endless amount of photos, the sky’s the limit (or until you&#8217;re out of local storage space).</p>

<p>Now one of the many reasons you love Plex is that we give your media the tender loving care that you do. Well, to that end, we’re happy to give you the ability to create beautiful, customizable Photo Albums. Want to share birthday photos and videos with your family? What about your recent trip to NYC? With all of our easy sorting features, like Places, Automatic Photo Tagging, and Timelines, you can easily curate your photos and videos into albums. Share them on your big screen, mobile device, on the web, or anywhere you use Plex. And don’t forget – all your photos can be downloaded in their glorious, and full resolution (unlike other cloud photo services).</p>
<p>Whether you were <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=voluntold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voluntold</a> that you’re the family event photographer, or you’re <em>the</em> videographer extraordinaire, albums allow you to curate the moments you want to use to tell your photo stories. Want to check out Places and create Photo Albums? Get <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Pass</a>, download and install the latest PMS (1.8.1+), and refresh all metadata in your photo libraries.</p>
<p>Because Photos and Videos are a part of Plex, you can access them from any device that supports Plex. So after finally catching up with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Walking Dead</a> (<em>and feeling a pit of despair from the unrelenting bleakness of it all</em>), you can recover with happier memories (preferably of a certain cute dog**). Right on your big screen TV, or your phone in the checkout line, or your laptop on a red-eye going home &#8212; <i>you get it</i>.<br />

Plex is <em>clearly</em> the most advanced solution for your memories. We&#8217;ve made it fun to organize all of your photos and videos in one beautiful app across all of your devices, on top of making it easy for you to find and re-discover your memories. Give Photos and Videos on Plex a try because, whether you have a penchant for taking duckfaced-selfies or you have an eye for a carefully-framed shot, your awe-inspiring photostream belongs with the rest of your media.</p>
<p><i>*It doesn&#8217;t actually use droids or deep neural networks.</i></p>
<p><em>**You know it’s Barkley. It’s always Barkley.</em><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I wonder whether people from past generations are so fondly remembered because their minor transgressions were never properly documented. It&#8217;s difficult to stage an appropriately embarrassing photo when each exposure takes 90 seconds. So much has changed, and I can&#8217;t quite shake the suspicion that some day a new batch of humans will entertain themselves primarily by mocking our current generation’s mishaps. You spend one ill-fated Halloween rocking a Jheri curl meticulously crafted from half a bottle of your sister&#8217;s hairspray and the world will never forget. What a time to be alive&#8230;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me (that is, one part photo nerd, one part data hoarder—I mean, digital lifestyle archivist), your photo library has been growing steadily since the early days of digital. For a while this was manageable: a few pics from a vacation, a snapshot here and there. A portrait of the kids (human or canine) in an especially adorable moment. Recently though, things have gotten pretty out of hand. The iPhone in my pocket is basically better quality than almost every Hasselblad that ever existed, my Facebook friends are clamoring for anything that&#8217;s not fake news, and let&#8217;s face it, Barkley&#8217;s not getting any less adorable. It&#8217;s the perfect storm, and the ensuing torrent of photos has given my Plex Camera Upload a workout. Really, it&#8217;s my cross to bear: these sunsets and eggs benedict brunches aren&#8217;t going to document themselves, right millennials!?</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-5813 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-800x533.jpg" alt="barkley-photo-cute" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-1800x1200.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-1440x960.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/barkley-photo-cute.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>So how do we dig our way out from under this massive pile of pixels? More importantly, how do we find the proverbial needles in this hipster haystack?</p>
<p>As of today, Plex can help!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re seriously leveling up the Plex photo experience. For starters, the photos and personal video that you shoot on your phone no longer need to live in separate libraries. Your &#8220;Photo&#8221; libraries now incorporate your personal videos too. Seamless, like Ansel Adams intended. Second, we&#8217;ve significantly enhanced the photo viewer in the Web app. It&#8217;s beautiful, and it&#8217;s just a hint at shiny new things to come across the board.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-5814 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-800x479.jpg" alt="Videos now live next to your Photos" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-800x479.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-768x460.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-1536x920.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-2048x1227.jpg 2048w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-1800x1078.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-1440x863.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-640x383.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-400x240.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-video-150x90.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>But we weren&#8217;t merely content with a few cosmetic fixes. We’ve also sped up the process of importing photos into Plex by up to 300%. But really, we wanted to help people <em>understand</em> their photo libraries. So starting today, our Plex Pass subscribers can now let Plex automatically tag all your photos with fun stuff like &#8220;kitten&#8221; and &#8220;irish setter&#8221; using advanced machine learning technology. This is useful in a few ways:</p>
<p>First of all, you can now search for images by using tags. For example, if I type in “Puppy” in the quick search bar, I instantly get results. It’s like magic!</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-5819 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-800x487.jpg" alt="Search tagged photos" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-800x487.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-1024x623.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-768x467.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-1536x935.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-2048x1247.jpg 2048w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-1800x1096.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-1440x877.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-640x390.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-400x243.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photos-search-tags-150x91.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Secondly, when you’re viewing a photo, you can now see related photos based on tags, and explore that related set. It’s amazingly addictive, and a great way of spelunking through years of memories.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-5816 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-800x479.jpg" alt="Related tags for Photos" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-800x479.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-768x460.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-1536x920.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-2048x1227.jpg 2048w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-1800x1079.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-1440x863.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-640x383.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-400x240.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cove-150x90.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Now for the fun part: I encourage you all to play a game. It&#8217;s kind of like Telephone, but the goal is to see how far you can get from where you started using only tags.

<p>My lovely wife has begun pursuing her second career as a photographer, so I thought it only appropriate to make a plug-in for her <a href="http://annakimphotography.com">web site</a>. Yes, that is a photo of me obsessing over a batch of sourdough loaves (thanks, Isaac). Yes, I am wearing pants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading John&#8217;s excellent post <a href="http://blog.kozubik.com/john_kozubik/2008/03/high-definition.html">over here</a>, I got to thinking about 1080p content (or &#8220;difficult&#8221; content, really) and how we might be able to better handle it. To begin, let&#8217;s go over the numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A typical uncompressed 1080p frame takes up 3 MB (megabytes). This is full resolution for the Y plane, and subsampled U and V planes.</li>
<li>This means that a single second of uncompressed video (24p) takes up almost 73 MB.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s a huge amount of bandwidth, compared to the compressed video. An episode of Lost I&#8217;m watching right now is hovering around 8 Mbps, which is 1 MB/sec. This is a pretty impressive compression ratio, and there also a few possibly interesting takeaways from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streaming uncompressed 1080p content over Gigabit Ethernet is theoretically possible, but only just barely.</li>
<li>Streaming uncompressed 1080p content off a typical hard drive is theoretically possible, but again, only just barely and only in &#8220;best case scenarios&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the problems we run into playing 1080p video content have to do with two the combination of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The existence of bursts of high bit-rate frame sequences (some only a second or two long, some 10s of seconds).</li>
<li>The fact that we do real-time decoding, so if a frame is late, we drop it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So here are some random ideas that were running through my head as I woke up this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decode buffer</strong>: Disk buffers work to smooth out arrival jitter in data from the disk, so we don&#8217;t we have a decode buffer to smooth out arrival jitter in the decoded frames? That way, if we run into a frame sequence where we would get behind, we can simply empty frames from the decode buffer. Since the CPU is usually ahead, we could simply decode as fast as we can, and accumulate some number of pre-decoded frames (in RAM). To keep 2 seconds of decoded frames would cost about 150MB of RAM, which is chump change these days. And even if we pre-filled the buffer before playing, the pre-roll delay would only be increased by at *most* 2 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Grid computing</strong>: Harness the power of your idle computers and have them decoding frames for you. The problem is the extreme bandwidth of the decoded frames, as mentioned. But perhaps apply some high quality MPEG-2 compression, and it becomes much more manageable. Presumably they could decode sequences between keyframes.</li>
<li><strong>Sidecar Preprocessing</strong>: Since MPEG-2 is easier to decompress, why not simply run a preprocessor over H.264 files? Any spots that are higher than a specified bitrate would be pre-decoded, encoded to high quality MPEG-2, and then stored in a &#8220;sidecar&#8221;, alongside the original media. Imagine &#8220;Planet.Earth.01.mkv&#8221; and then &#8220;Planet.Earth.01.mkv.sidecar.00:02:01-00:02:40.mpeg2&#8221; (assuming the sidecars start and end on second boundaries). The sidecar format could be anything appropriate, and it wouldn&#8217;t have to store audio or other metadata (e.g. subtitles). Best of all, they could be whacked at any point or recomputed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Of course, the sidecar media could also just be lower bit-rate H.264, that way ffmpeg wouldn&#8217;t need to be any the wiser.</p>
<p>Hope you&#8217;re all having a great weekend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Changes in this version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos play at the right speed, and donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t lock up. Even seeking works.</li>
<li>Audio now works during video playback, including DTS and AC3 passthrough!!</li>
<li>SDLâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s OpenGL vertical sync support is enabled, to avoid tearing.</li>
<li>If we canâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t open the selected audio device, try opening the default device. Might prevent some crashes.</li>
<li>Integrated fix for Mac Mini OpenGL issue, it *should* run there too (but I havenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t tested it).</li>
</ul>
<p>The hardest piece of work for this release was tracking down a nefarious deadlock in CSharedSection. Deadlocks are a pain in the ass to track down, and the method Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve always used is quite simple: printf. I run the program inside gdb, wait for it to deadlock, and then backtrack with the printf output to see what went wrong (looking at thread stack traces to see where the threads blocked). Tracking down this particular problem took me about four hours, which is about par for the course. I would have bet money that it was a bug in my code, since Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve rewritten the critical section and event code (both of which CSharedSection relies upon heavily), but it turned out to be a bug in the class itself.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/deadlock.jpg" alt="deadlock.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Once I fixed the problem the movie <span style="font-style: italic">187</span> (my test video, for whatever reason), played through until the end, at turbo speed. I watched it for a few minutes, left the house, and when I returned I had a glorious kernel panic staring at me (although I could see that the movie had ended, at least). I havenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t seen any panics since, perhaps something to do with the fact that playing it so fast taxed the system much harder than usual. Plus it turns out the debug line on the screen (showing memory, CPU, etc.) isnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t thread safe with the video rendering code so that could have had something to do with it too (although it should never kernel panic, of course).</p>
<div style="text-align: left">
  Once I got the audio working (through Portaudio), the video played at normal speed. This was so exhilarating that I started watching <span style="font-style: italic">Along Came Polly</span> and my wife came and sat with me and we watched the whole thing. (I have to admit, I was half expecting it to crash halfway through, but it didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t.)
</div>
<div style="text-align: left">
  
</div>
<div style="text-align: left">
<p>It was about this time when I realized that the mix-down code was ALSA dependent, so my only hope for multi-channel audio was through my surround receiver. I crossed my fingers, redirected the audio to Digital Output, and selected a video with AC3. It worked!!! DTS worked as well, which was incredibly exciting, because Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve never found another application on OS X which could do DTS passthrough. No speaker-abusing audio glitches, either, like those that happen with some of the applications that try to feign passthrough with QuickTime. The way I&#8217;ve coded it is that if encoded digital audio is to be played, it looks for an output with &#8220;Digital&#8221; in it (thanks to the people who contributed data on this!). Otherwise it plays to the selected output in Audio Hardware. This isn&#8217;t perfect, but it&#8217;s probably a decent first take.</p>
<p>
  After fixing a few more bugs (seeking, OpenGL threading weirdness), and just for giggles, we decided to try to watch our nightly <span style="font-style: italic">Six Feet Under</span> on our Sony TV, which is connected to the second DVI port on my Mac. I changed the XBMC resolution to 1080i (and had to change it in the video settings as well), and moved the window over to the second display (with Anna yelling from around the corner â€œrightâ€¦upâ€¦a bit moreâ€¦.stop!â€) and we watched S03E03. Worked perfectly. One interesting note: Since it wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t officially full-screen, the first display wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t black, so it would have been possible to check email or do something else while the other person was using XBMC. This is an advantage over Front Row, which takes over your entire display.
</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left">
  
</div>
<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/img-1400.jpg" alt="IMG_1400.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Next up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use an optimized, assembly-enabled (and non-buggy) ffmpeg.</li>
<li>Get full-screen display working.</li>
<li>Lots of other bugsâ€¦</li>
</ul>
<p>At that point, it should be possible to actually to use XBMC on a TV with a halfway decent experience, and certainly better than that which Front Row offers.</p>
<p>I uploaded the new binary (why bother uploading an entire new package, right?) <a href="http://dn-0.com/xbmc-trac/attachment/wiki/WikiStart/XBMC-0.0.2.gz">here</a>. Enjoy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who experience a green screen when viewing videos, download this <a href="http://dn-0.com/xbmc-trac/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/OSXBMC-0.01.tar.gz">new version</a>. I&#8217;ve disabled the ATI-specific OpenGL renderer, since (a) I&#8217;m not quite sure what its raison d&#8217;Ãªtre was and (b) it was causing trouble on OS X (and apparently Linux, as well).</p>
<p>Anyway, ATI users should have better luck with this version. This doesn&#8217;t mean video is actually working, but hey, it might render a few frames for you. In order. At some random speed. But beggars can&#8217;t be choosers, right?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, I&#8217;ve finally managed to get all my changes checked in. Here&#8217;s what seems to be working:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Music</strong>: MP3, OGG, AAC, FLAC, MPC.</li>
<li><strong>Photos</strong>: Slideshows, viewing.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>: Almost completely broken, but should show first few seconds, at turbo speed. No audio. Fun to play around with, though.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong>: ProjectM works, but there are graphical artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Misc</strong>: Video thumbnails, IMDB, AllMusic lookups.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s completely unimplemented or broken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-screen mode.</li>
<li>Python.</li>
<li>Virtual Filesystem layer (e.g. reading from RAR, zip, etc.)</li>
<li>Lots of other stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to let people play with it (hey, it&#8217;s a great music and slideshow player!), I&#8217;ve built a release. This is a really early release, so running it may corrupt your drive, give your kids chicken pox, or ruin your credit.</p>
<p>If you want to run a binary release, <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/83628909/OSXBMC-0.01.tar.gz.html">download it here</a>. Unpack it, set the XBMC_HOME environment variable to point to the XBMC directory that&#8217;s created, and try running it. Your milage may vary, and I really can&#8217;t spend much time at all tracking down end users&#8217; problems, unfortunately. I recommend you <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=56">post to the forum</a> and help each other out, if possible.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need the following libraries installed (and I recommend you use MacPorts to install them) to run the release: libcdio, libfreetype, libfribidi, libGLEW, libiconv, liblzo, libsqlite, libz.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You&#8217;ll also need to delete the file system/profiles.xml before you start, otherwise you&#8217;ll get a gray screen on boot. I should have removed this file before packaging things up. Thanks to UKP for pointing this out.</p>
<p>If you want to compile the release, hopefully because you want to help out in the development, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87054">check out the source</a> from SVN, and then use one of the three following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use XCode to build the Debug version (production has issues).</li>
<li>Use xcodebuild to build on the command line, using something like this &#8220;xcodebuild -parallelizeTargets -configuration Debug&#8221;</li>
<li>Use Eclipse to build (which will call xcodebuild). The .cproject and .project files are checked in, and you&#8217;ll need to install the CDT, of course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck.</p>
