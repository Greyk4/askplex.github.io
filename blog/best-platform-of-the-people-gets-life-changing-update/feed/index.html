					<description><![CDATA[The new search is terribly slow in comparison, and not nearly as useful.  I was at Walmart yesterday, and I noticed some videos in the $5 bin I did not recognize.   I only get 3G inside Walmart, so I&#039;m on a slow data connection.   But in the past that hasn&#039;t stopped me from searching my database to find out if I have a movie.   But in this case it was so slow, I finally gave up.

It seem the reason it is so slow is it not just searches my content, but it searches the web.   Results frequently include dozens or even hundreds of clips I don&#039;t own.   When I&#039;m at a computer if I click on those, I always get a content not found error or such.   As such the results are useless.   On the phone it means it is spending a long time downloading images and descriptions for things I don&#039;t have, when I just want to see what I do have.   Further, I want the search to be context sensitive.   If I&#039;m searching movies I don&#039;t want to see results for music...   The worst is when I&#039;m searching for a movie that is also the name of a tv series...

I used to keep a text file on my phone that listed all my movies.   It looks like I&#039;ll have to go back to doing that.

BTW.  The director and actor filters do not seem very reliable.   Sometimes for example I&#039;ll click on a Director link in a movie description and a whole list of other movies will come up.   Other times I just get a blank page, even though they are actually listed as Director for many movies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Currently, there aren&#039;t any Plex apps for Ubuntu Touch. There &quot;is&quot; a web app that&#039;s been published for Ubuntu Touch but it lacks the same usability features that the mobile app has. 

That particular OS is making headway and a mobile app &quot;could&quot; go a long way to increased adoption to the platform. The OS uses QML as it&#039;s main language for applications.

What would it take to get the Plex app (as seen on iOS or Android) ported to Ubuntu Touch? Would a petition be enough? If so, how many signatures would you need to see before interest was high enough for resources to be devoted to the platform? How much help are you willing to accept from the uTouch community? 



Thanks in advance!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Emilio, no - not the ROKU APP, the web client. We no longer have the ability to turn off the junk we don&#039;t want to see on the dashboard. I want recently added at the top. I don&#039;t want to see three MASSIVE space wasting &quot;Continue watching&quot; titles where there could be six. with a scroller for more.  In short, please give me the control back the way it was before this update. Also, what about the count of movies in my library? Sometimes there, sometimes not. Poof - disappeared - was just there a second ago before I refreshed.  Can we get this stuff back to where it was?]]></description>
