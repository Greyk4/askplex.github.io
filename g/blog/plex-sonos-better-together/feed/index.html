In theory, yes. In reality, Plex/Sonos service struggles to even connect on a track by track basis... This service needs some love you guys.

Your music discovery section is where you need to start recommending better Smart playlists based on recent activity as well as pushing playlists of music I haven&#039;t listened to in a while.

And genre browsing.

And ability to add any section or sub-section to favorites. Like Recently Played. I want my Sonos alarm to be set to Recent activity but you can&#039;t do that yet.

It&#039;s funny, and this part isn&#039;t Plex&#039;s fault, but the Sonos controller is so bad, it&#039;s easier to add a Chromecast Audio to your Play:5 and just cast to that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This integration was working fine until the machine running the plex blew up.  I replaced the machine (different name).  Removed the old machine from plex (doesn&#039;t show up in my plex servers anymore).  The new server shows up in Roku and the plex server menu.  But the sonos integration insists on showing the old server name and no music is accessible.  I have added and removed and relinked the plex server from sonos labs services multiple times.  It does not let me select a plex server (I have 2) and it selects a server that does not exist.  Remote access to both existing plex servers is working.]]></description>

It&#039;s working here for us on 7.0. If you have the time and can post some details in our Sonos forum it would be appreciated. have you restarted your server? what version of  server are you running?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Plex was working in the Sonos app (although unreliably) until I updated Plex to 7.0 just today, as prompted to do so in the app. Now the Plex tab is useless, and I can&#039;t search for any of my Plex media. Damn shame, and I guess I&#039;m returning to BubbleUPnP to send Plex tracks to my Sonos speakers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy holidays everyone!

What are the chances that, as a wonderful holday gift, we can get even an update about the status of this? It&#039;s been four months and there has not been a peep from Plex either here, or in the Beta discussion form, about any progress on anything. No response to bug reports, or a timeline, or a plan, or really any information at all about whether this &quot;beta&quot; is all that&#039;s ever going to happen on this front.

A little bit of information would really go a long way. I don&#039;t need a promise. I just want to know whether or not anyone&#039;s actually working on this any more, or of I should just expect there will never be an update to the beta.]]></description>

Movies are big files that need lots of Drive space, Plex is great for that. Music files are small and I have my music library with me in various forms 24/7. I have on my iPad, iPod, phone, I even have it on a flash drive in my car stereo. I literally don&#039;t leave home without it. 

The Plex music app doesn&#039;t sound  like something I&#039;d really use, but good luck. If you get around to making a new Sonos remote, I&#039;ll be first in line. ]]></description>

 some folk only want their music files catalogued by one app. the point of plex is so you can stream anywhere there is a Plex Player app all from a single central server  even when you are not at your home. Also if your friends have Plex Media Servers with music they can share with you.  even if their Plex Media Server is on the other side of the planet you can stream to your Sonos or any other Plex compatible device.]]></description>

I don&#039;t really need Sonos for video, though I&#039;d probably use it if it was available. I was really just seeing if the Sonos app for Plex would let us do anything we couldn&#039;t already do. It&#039;s another way to get the same content to your Sonos System, right? 

The thing is, I have to open the Sonos app on my iPad to get to the Plex feature to play music. But if the Sonos app is open, I can just play my music from there, I don&#039;t need Plex. It&#039;s a music app within a music app. Sonos isn&#039;t portable so it&#039;s always hooked to my music library, I don&#039;t need remote access for that. So what&#039;s this Plex app for? 

I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing something. Why do I need this Plex app?]]></description>
