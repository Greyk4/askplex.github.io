					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plex.tv/blog/one-more-thing-2/#comment-46151&quot;&gt;Chris Umiastowski&lt;/a&gt;.

@Chris: To paraphrase &quot;I was one who sent all those people over to be offensive to Plex, its developers, and its user-base. But really, I only did this because I want Plex on the BlackBerry.&quot;

Next time, call or write :)]]></description>

It was a joke.  Think about how insane it is that your feelings are getting hurt over someone joking about a piece of electronic equipment you bought. I mean really??...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree, a harmless funny joke. Blackberry users are a sad bunch of folks that is for sure. RIM needs to be kicked while they are down, the majority of the users are corporate users who&#039;s IT department know BES and are too afraid to move to anything else. Times are a changing though and I do not see RIM surviving another 5 years if they do not re-invent the wheel.

The majority of the people posting negative comments here are just doing it because of the calling of arms by crackberry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WOW,notice how the comments were all fun and games until Chris Umiastowski showed up. This guy blogged/whined about the lack of class shown by Plex for insulting blackberry - and ironically insults the nook color in the same sentiment - so no class AND a hypocrite?) and a bunch of fanboys and his followers came to bash and cry over it. Are you kidding me? All these ridiculous comments about how these 77 millions subscribers (maybe, but not smart phones owners with its current (AND STILL DROPPING 15% market share) are all offended and bringing the storm. I&#039;m not dissing RIM, that is just the state its in. Hopefully, RIM can come back from the severe damage this article caused. Most of he people complaining here don&#039;t even know about plex. RIDICULOUS]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok.  So this whole thing was by my design and I&#039;m very happy with the progress that I hope is unfolding.

[*SNIP*...rehash of how offended Chris was by the post]

So, back to business.  Plex is an AMAZING APP.  I&#039;m not going to abandon it just because the person running this blog had poor taste at the time.  For all I know he&#039;s a cool guy who usually doesn&#039;t act like this.

I want Plex on my Playbook.  I&#039;ll BUY it when it&#039;s out.  I just want to see Plex and the RIM team work together to get it done.

The native dev kit that RIM has is amazing.  This can get done!  I know you&#039;re resource strapped, but that shouldn&#039;t stop you.

Price the app at $5 and you&#039;ll get a LOT of customers on BlackBerry products.  Playbook today and BB10 in the next year. Be the best damn home streaming solution that the RIM platform has.  Everyone will buy this app.  Millions of people.

Will that justify the resources?  I think it will.  Make it happen.  We&#039;re all hoping you will.  We&#039;ll forgive the poor joke :)]]></description>
