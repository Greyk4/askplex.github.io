					<description><![CDATA[I really dislike the new app. Slow as molasses and it took an hour of swearing and yelling and actually deleting the app and trying to load the old one before I realized that I&#039;m stuck with this. What a crappy situation. There is no way after tapping on every menu item I could find to get to that Sync screen you show up there and I can&#039;t control sync any more and that&#039;s the ONLY reason so use the app for me. You&#039;ve ruined my upcoming flight because I was going to watch my app but now that this new bullshit has arrived I&#039;m probably going to have to use my Kindle and read.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just bought the app for my iPad. Had been using VLC but since Apple blocked AC3 on VLC. Got tired of transoding my libary with ffmpeg and was looking for something else.

For some reasons, some videos play while others just don&#039;t; no error message, just a quiet return to the menu after it thinks about playing for a few secs.

Would really like to see some VLC like controls like the volume, brighness, fwd/bwd swipe guestures, changinging aspect ratios and being able to  turn on/off subtitles while watching videos.]]></description>

@josh  If you are having issues with other clients as well then it might be the server but hard to say without more info. If you have not already can you post server and/or iOS logs in our forums https://forums.plex.tv  . Here is info on how to get logs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200250417-Plex-Media-Server-Log-Files&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Server Logs&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201636593-iOS-Logs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;iOS logs&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Love the new iOS app. But it is not working with the latest Plex  0.9.16.3.
I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the plex client or the plex server. I can see my whole library videos and music.
But I can&#039;t play anything. I&#039;m running Synology 110j. Using direct play since I have everything in mp4 h.264 format and container. The music is mp3&#039;s. My roku client is also a little glitchy. 

Please help. Just don&#039;t know if I should downgrade to an older version of the server or wait for the latest ios update.

thanks.]]></description>
