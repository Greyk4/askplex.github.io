					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m disappointed I missed the Rick Roll as I must not have used Plex that day.

I love plex and have been a user for many years. I am eternally grateful for all the hard work Elan has put into this project over the years and am an enthusiastic supporter of the platform and a plex pass subscriber. That said, I do not feel that my financial support or public support of the program entitles me to criticize or to otherwise deride Elan or the plex team for building a practical joke into the code.

Plex has always, to a large part, been about community and the fact that they now accept limited financial contributions does not give any of us the right to make demands. Indeed, the Rick Roll prank may have been inconvenient for some, but it was not profane, lude or otherwise inappropriate for any age group.

Thank you Elan for all your hard work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure where else to put this :

I&#039;m not a big fan of how music is displayed in the android PLex pass app compared to the normal app.  Plex pass uses a tile based list which to me feels un-natural.  The normal list based title scrolling feels quicker and better to use, also it&#039;s what people are used to.

It would be good if you&#039;d allow us to choose how we want to view the music list.

Cheers.  Keep up the good work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plex.tv/blog/happy-april-fools-day/#comment-49705&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;.

@rickroll ~ I totally understand how in the environment profplump is using Plex, the rickroll would be entirely inappropriate, and I&#039;m sorry about that. That having been said, we&#039;re not pretending to specifically make educational software, so it&#039;s hard for us to anticipate this sort of thing in advance. We&#039;ll definitely try to be more aware of all the different environments where Plex is being used before planning our next April Fool&#039;s day :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Cory - I found your response to @profplump much more inflammatory than anything he every said in this thread.

profplump had some valid criticisms of the April 1 rickroll and how it affected his particular use of the software.

As I am also a financial supporter of Plex (PlexPass member and IOS apps), I can understand his point of view - although the rickroll didn&#039;t affect me as I just use Plex for home.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@DJLunacy I&#039;ve supported Plex financially every time they&#039;ve asked, for both services (PlexPass) and mobile clients. I&#039;ve supplied patches for the open-source portions of the project and helped with debugging. I contributed code to the upstream projects long before Plex ever existed. I&#039;ve offered to provide fixes and enhancements for the closed-source portion of the product. I participate in the forums to provide support for other users. I publish my integration and administration tools to make Plex more useful for everyone. I add and curate data at thetvdb (and providing funding for that project) to keep Plex working with episodic content. And I&#039;ve installed Plex in a number of places outside my home and encourage others to use it, helping bolster the user base.

Exactly what else do I need to do before I can request that Plex work in a way I think would be? And how can the Plex team possibly know how their users would like the software to work unless we tell them? You can disagree with my thoughts on how Plex should work, but you don&#039;t get to tell me I can&#039;t have or express them just because the advertised price of the PMS is $0.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[profplump -- Your complaining and analogy are flawed. Of course if somebody bought a car blah blah and ________ happened they would complain..

THEY BOUGHT THE CAR.

You&#039;re using free software. If they want to rickroll you until the cows come home they can.  Uninstall it and find something else.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I removed a movie because of this.
Got a movie from the web &quot;Legally&quot; of course.
My Monkeys started to work put everything in place made popcorn 1L coke.
Hit PLay and ... awww chuckle chuckle I got Rick Rolled from behind deeply.

Removed the movie because I though it was a fake.
Nice one Plex]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The other night, I broke the house rules and touched my wife&#039;s computer... She hadn&#039;t been feeling well so went to bed early and I hadn&#039;t anything better to do, so I decided I&#039;d try to set up her Mac to pull videos off the Tivo and then share them back out on the network with Plex.  After system updates and several attempts to get the SAN mounted, I finally got PLEX up, running and scanning my media.  Just one thing left to do before going to bed...  what the.... Rick Astley?  My wife is going to kill me!  Good one PLEX!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had just spent hours diagnosing and fixing network issues and a Plex server that refused to start up after an Ubuntu upgrade. The first video I launched was the new Doctor Who. The rickroll started and I ran to the server to verify the correct file was downloaded. It was in fact correct. Good job.

One request: I would love to have a music videos section.]]></description>
