										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>First, the backstory. Remember TV?</h3>
<p>In the beginning, there was TV. And TV was good. It worked like this—you walked into a room, you turned it on, something started playing, and you sat down. Were there choices? Sure. Depending on which decade you spent your formative years in, it coulda been four. Didn’t like what was on that particular channel? Well, you could stand up, turn the dial, and maaaaaybe find something better on. Then the remote came along and with it, channel surfing. And that was also good. All of a sudden you had twenty, thirty, even forty different choices. Turns out, there was usually “something good” on.</p>
<div class="responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/440042479" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<h3>Programming via fax machine</h3>
<p>We loved it because it was simple and we hated it because it was simple. You didn’t have to make a lot of decisions. And there was always something next. There was even a job at TV networks called “the programmer.” And the programmers would stay up all night and debate what was the exact order that shows should be shared with you. Each morning every studio executive would get a fax at five in the morning with something called “the overnights.” And they would know whether or not they had done their job DJ’ing your TV selection as their morning coffee brewed.</p>
<h3>And now, for some breaking news, we go live</h3>

<p>Today Plex is bringing it all back (except for the fax machine, still working on that integration) with free Live TV for everyone, in all 220+ countries that Plex serves. With over <strong>80+ channels</strong> (plus even more coming soon) across all your favorite genres. And this is in addition to the 14,000 (and counting) free movies, documentaries, and TV shows you can find on Plex on-demand, so there’s always something on to fit your mood. Whether it’s live news like <strong>Reuters</strong>, or kids shows like <strong>Toon Goggles</strong>, cooking shows on <strong>Tastemade</strong>, or sports on <strong>fubo Sports Network</strong>, or even eSports on <strong>IGN TV</strong>, we’ve got you covered.</p>
<h3>P.S. all you cord-cutters—add Antenna TV + Live TV and you get Ultimate TV</h3>
<p>If you’re a Plex antenna TV user, then you already know the joys of cord-cutting. With an antenna, tuner, and Plex Pass, many of you already use Plex to stream live local TV to all your devices. Now we’ve expanded your live TV offering for the best of all worlds—free on-demand movies, live local TV, and <strong>80+ streams</strong> of free TV—just to make sure you bathe in the golden rays of television at all times. Look for future improvements to provide options to make navigating the grid even easier and more intuitive.</p>
<h3>Broaden your horizons</h3>

<p>Now you can tune into an entire channel where Bob Ross teaches you how to paint landscapes (on—what else—<strong>The Bob Ross Channel</strong>), one carefree stroke after another. Go on a surf safari with <strong>Surf Now TV</strong>, or learn how to up your dating game on <strong>Love Destination.</strong></p>

<p>Finding safe and sane kids programming is often a challenge for busy parents (some of whom have unfortunately had the disconcerting discovery of what Junior has stumbled onto in that epic four-hour YouTube binge). Now we have fun options for the whole gang like <strong>Kidoodle TV</strong>, <strong>Monster Kids</strong>, <strong>KidsFlix</strong> (noticing a theme yet?), <strong>Squad</strong>, <strong>Toon Goggles</strong>, and <strong>Toon Goggles Jr</strong>. Sweet wholesome serenity (with just enough sliming to keep it real).</p>

<p>If my Google Translate was working properly, here’s where I’d write something super witty in Spanish about our new Spanish language feeds, but let’s just all agree, it’s going to be muy caliente with such offerings as <strong>AFV Español</strong> and <strong>Latin X Pop</strong>. Additionally, there is <strong>BAMBU</strong> for top Chinese entertainment, <strong>KMTV</strong> for all things K-pop, and <strong>AsianCrush</strong> and <strong>YUYU TV</strong> for streams that encompass entertainment far and beyond.</p>

<p>The boat show? Yep, if you’re into boats—or you want to sound like <a href="https://youtu.be/a7NarmrZeC4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a guy who just bought a boat</a>—then now there’s <strong>The Boat Show</strong>. Is there a time and place to watch a network exclusively dedicated to boats? We also have <strong>Choppertown</strong> for those who like to <a href="https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/09/19/heres-a-florida-man-driving-a-street-legal-jet-ski-on-the-highway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drive boats on two wheels down a road</a>.

<p>If you are a pet lover, an animal aficionado, or just plain passionate about parrots (aren’t we all??), tune into <strong>The Pet Collective</strong> and get your fill of smol little baby things, or just leave it on for doggos when you…… go to the other side of the couch to work? Or like, if you just like the four-legged frenz—watch all your favorite furry creatures romp and roll until your heart’s content.</p>

<p>Hey, remember when MTV stood for Music Television instead of, um, the worst of human behavior in bite-sized reality-TV flavored chunks? Well, now you can bring back your own favorite TRL (shout out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AbSd9zd_M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carson Daly</a>!) for your favorite genres: watch everything from <strong>80s Party</strong> to <strong>Party Tyme Karaoke</strong> to <strong>Texas-Sized Hits</strong> and <strong>Electro Anthems</strong>. But wait, what’s that you say? Hold the champagne, put a pause on the Grey Poupon—“Will Plex have the <strong>Yacht Rock</strong> channel?” You bet your sweet docksiders we do! (And whichever therapist told you that you could watch a Bob Seger video too many times, well, they’re just plain wrong.)</p>

<p>Whether you’re thirsty for courtroom television, or behind the scenes of Hollywood, or stand-up comedy, romance, queer cinema, Plex has got a streaming channel for you.</p>
<p>So open up Plex on your phone, smart TV, laptop, or tablet and start streaming. Updates are rolling out throughout the day for Apple TV, iOS devices, Roku, Amazon Fire, Android mobile, Android TV, and <a href="https://app.plex.tv">web desktop</a>, with updates for smart TVs and gaming consoles coming shortly. As with all of Plex’s sources, you can customize the order and visibility of Live TV by re-ordering, unpinning, or even hiding it using your personal settings.</p>
<h3>Create your own kid-friendly channel line-up</h3>
<p>Are your kids old enough to grab the remote from your loving hands? Well now you can fine-tune live TV on Plex for them by setting up a managed user and remove any channels from their lineup you don’t want them watching. You get to be the benevolent overlord who controls the channels your kids get to surf. To learn more about managed user accounts, check out this <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/203948776-managed-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how-to article</a>.</p>
<h3>And now a word from our sponsor</h3>
<p>We’re able to make all of these streams free by having limited—bathroom—commercial breaks. As some astute viewers may have noticed, we’re also experimenting with our first on-air promos. If you love to make silly / emotional / style-ish / profound spots yourselves, drop us a line and we’ll see if we can find a way to feature community-made spots in the mix as well.</p>
<h3>Now you get to do it live too</h3>
<p>So open it up, give it a whirl, and let us know what you think below. If you have any questions, be sure to check our handy support <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/free-live-tv-streaming-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview</a> and <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/faq-live-tv-on-plex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a>.

<h3>Together, but… not</h3>
<p>Hey. So, yeah, times are a little weird right now. We continue to hear from folks how Plex is making their lives a little better under the circumstances, and we couldn&#8217;t be more honored to be a part of that. Our friend Joe tweeted us with a great suggestion the other day:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/plex?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@plex</a> If you currently don’t have your code-ninjas working hard on a built-in ability to host watch parties using your system, I can’t understand why.<br />What an amazing gift to your current subscribers and opportunity to spread/promote the Plex love to a lot more eyeballs.</p>
<p>&mdash; Joe (@joepodell) <a href="https://twitter.com/joepodell/status/1261134735360884737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h3>Plot twist: Joe is a friggin’ mind reader</h3>
<p>It was timely. And a bit prescient. Joe, it turns out our code ninjas have been working hard on building exactly that. It&#8217;s less about getting eyeballs and more about letting people reconnect with each other remotely through the media they love, but credit where it&#8217;s due, Joe, for scooping us on the feature. Frankly, community—whether in-person or virtual—is something that we&#8217;ve all grown a new appreciation for over the past months. So yep, we&#8217;re right there with you.</p>

<h3>Make virtual movie dates a reality</h3>
<p>Today we&#8217;re announcing beta support for an experimental new feature we call <strong>Watch Together</strong>. Find a movie or episode you want to watch together, invite your friends on Plex (or even invite them to join Plex), and let us handle keeping playback in sync for everyone. It&#8217;s pretty great. No more &#8220;okay pressing play in 3, 2, 1&#8230;&#8221; or suffering through the third act in desperate need of a bathroom break. Anyone watching with you can play, pause, or seek around during the session. Before you ask, yes, “that guy” can ruin it for everyone. Pro tip: maybe don&#8217;t invite “<a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/movie/the-cable-guy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that guy</a>” to <strong>Watch Together</strong> with you.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/watch-together-screens-final.gif" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16390" /></p>
<h3>All together now</h3>
<p>As of today, <strong>Watch Together</strong> is supported on Apple platforms (iOS and tvOS), Android platforms (mobile and TV), FireTV, NVIDIA SHIELD and Roku – make sure to update to the latest release. Support for web and other platforms to follow soon. <strong>Watch Together</strong> works with both our free on-demand movies and TV shows and content from your personal media library.  So now your whole extended family can re-watch old videos of your kids playing sportsball even though your parents are thousands of miles away. Or binge on one of our free streaming TV shows (<a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/mary-berry-everyday" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mary Berry</a> anyone?) with your friends across town. It’s never been easier.  For this first iteration, choose your favorite non-Plex app to chat—video, audio, or text—to hang out while you watch. Pausing the movie on one device will pause it for everyone so that we all stay in sync and no one misses a beat.</p>
<h3>Safety not guaranteed</h3>
<p>Some notes: First, this is very much an experimental feature. There&#8217;s a metric tonne of improvements and integrations that we would love to add, and there are some sharp edges, but right now we&#8217;re mostly looking for feedback. How&#8217;s it working for you? Do you long for an integrated voice, text, or video chat? (Obviously, you can just fire up a Zoom or WhatsApp or Houseparty for the time being.) More power to invite additional audience members on the fly? The ability to kick/ban? (You invited “<a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/mr-bean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that guy</a>” didn&#8217;t you?) Maybe even a larger watch party where one or two folks “on the stage” do the speaking (like turning on the director’s commentary on your old faded BluRays)? How would you like to customize your personal viewing party? Let us know in the forums or comments below.</p>
<h3>Straight outta Plex Labs</h3>
<p><strong>Watch Together</strong> comes to you hot outta Plex Labs and will be free to everyone while it remains in official beta. No Plex Pass needed for the time being. So jump in, take it for a spin, and reconnect with some long lost friends over some old favorites or new discoveries.</p>
<p>You’ll find <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/watch-together/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">usage instructions</a> as well as answers to <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/frequently-asked-questions-watch-together/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frequently asked questions</a> on our support site. Something broken or irksome? You could always mention us in an angry tweet, but for best results we suggest you direct your feedback to our <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/tags/c/testing/plex-labs/16/watch-together" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">support forum</a>.</p>
<h3>So sync up, tune in, and chill out</h3>
<p>Give it a shot. Let us know what you think. More importantly, stay safe out there. Stay home. And Watch Together.</p>

<p>Yeah, well you can skip all that now.</p>

<h3>Binge-watching nirvana</h3>
<p>Introducing our brand new Plex Pass feature called (duh) Skip Intro. If you’ve ever binge-watched anything, you know the secret to achieving that smooth multi-episode groove is all about reducing the non-essentials. So our engineers sharpened their pencils and, um, slid their slide-rules in order to figure out how to dynamically skip intros for basically any type of show. That is, without having to manually identify on every single episode what is an opening intro and what is just a kick-ass music break at the start of an episode. When you add in cold-opens, different credits for different seasons, and regional variations, it starts to become a rather thorny problem. </p>
<p>Long story short, we updated your Plex Media Server to analyze your shows in the background in order to deliver some next-level pattern recognition. Once it&#8217;s finished processing, you&#8217;ll see that friendly <strong>Skip Intro</strong> button appear in your supported player app. Magic.</p>
<h3>To boldly go where no DVR has gone before</h3>
<p>Think of it as another reason to get that digital antenna and tuner and set up Plex Live TV and DVR. In addition to watching and recording dozens of HD over-the-air broadcast channels for FREE (here in the States that includes networks like CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX, and PBS plus dozens more depending on your local market), now you can skip intros on all of your recorded shows. Only two caveats: the intro sequence must be at least 20 seconds long (keep reading to see why) and you’ll need a Plex Pass for your playback device. As of today, you’ll see it working on the latest releases of our iOS, Android, Roku, Fire TV, and Web clients – once you’ve updated your Plex Media Server and let it process your TV content.</p>
<h3>Show me the histograms</h3>
<p>A little peek under the hood: The secret ingredient is creating an audio &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; out of the histogram of each episode in a given season of each TV show. It turns out that the vast majority of show intros share common audio signatures for all their episodes (at least for a specific season). After applying some heuristics and a little bit of Special Sauce<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, we&#8217;re able to predict (in almost all cases) precisely when the intro starts and ends. Voila! Get precious minutes of your life back, one episode at a time.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago we <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/remastered-thanks-to-you-our-brand-new-tv-navigation-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spelled out</a> some imminent changes to our TV UI, and intimated that great things were to come across the board. “UNO is the future!” we said (“UNO” being our internal code name for the new UI paradigm across all platforms). None of us quite knew why “UNO” was capitalized since it’s not an acronym. “Blame Jason!” we said, and Jason was asleep at the time, so we went with it.</p>
<h3>So what is all this hullabaloo about UNO anyway?</h3>
<p>In case you missed it, UNO is our latest effort to streamline the process of searching, discovering and enjoying your content in your Plex library—no matter the type, no matter the source, no matter the format. It’s an easy, elegant, and powerful system that’s consistent no matter where and how you Plex. It gives you the ultimate control over how you navigate your collection.</p>
<h3>Benefits include: Niftier navigation</h3>
<p>We restore some basic usability qualities that suffered a bit under our “type-first” implementation.</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/navigating-the-big-screen-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fewer clicks to get where you want to go.</a></li>
<li>More discoverable actions and sources.</li>
<li>More intuitive navigation patterns.</li>
<li>Fewer distractions with things you shouldn’t have to care about.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A powerful new sidebar</h3>
<p>In addition to being a better use of screen space than the top menu, it lets you see all the stuff you care about, none of the stuff you don’t, and it gets out of the way when you don’t need to look at it.</p>
<h3>Rolling out wide across the Plexverse</h3>
<p>Fast forward a few months, and now we’re on the precipice of realizing that very vision: the UNO UI is rolling out across all TV platforms this week, it’s <em>super</em> close on iOS and coming thereafter on Android, but importantly this marks the mainstream release of our most sacred (and challenging!) release of all: our beloved Web app.</p>
<h3>Which brings us to our friendly neighborhood Web app</h3>
<p>The Plex Web app is a bit of a special beast, since it serves as both a super popular platform for consuming media and the singular app to admin and curate your Media Servers. We’re fairly confident this app embodies the best of both worlds: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-plex-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimate customization</a> for the media consumer and improved control and curation for the server owner and administrator. It’s always a fun balancing act between the two—and many thanks to everyone who has given feedback along the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it’s already April, which somehow scored the three biggest holidays of the year. Seriously, March and August have got to be facepalming themselves with frustration, wondering how April got all the coolness. What other month do you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay the piper</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2019/apr/01/april-fools-day-2019-the-best-jokes-and-pranks-in-one-place" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fool the piper</a>, and <a href="https://giphy.com/explore/420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smoke the piper</a> all within a thirty-day blur?</p>
<p>It also means April happens to be the perfect time to talk about how we’ve added a bit more kick to our already-tasty TIDAL x Plex musical brew with some spicy new enhancements. And to demonstrate exactly how smooth and flavorful this cocktail is, watch as we serve it up to an unsuspecting music aficionado whose universe – and quite possibly his very conception of reality – is about to be completely rocked in sixty seconds flat.</p>

<em>by Hugh Newell</em></p>
<h3>In which we introduce Hector, the hero of our story</h3>
<p>Meet my friend Hector. He’s what you call a <a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/who-are-the-musicians-musicians.497702/page-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">musician’s musician</a>. As well as a fan’s fan. And of course he’s <em>also</em> a waiter’s waiter because, well, the first two things.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hector has been using Plex for well on three and a half years. And he likes to tell me (in between the <em>amuse bouche</em> and the <em>antipasto</em> courses at the rather delicious Italian restaurant he’s working at) that he loves Plex and has tweaked all of his album art to make his library a living monument to Shag (the <a href="http://www.shag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artist</a>, not the <a href="https://flashbak.com/shag-carpet-and-the-sleazy-seventies-19216/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">carpet</a>, though at a certain point in the evening it all kinda becomes one and the same in an <a href="http://www.faberhama.com/Ouroboros-Rug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ouroboros</a> sorta way). After he sweeps away our garlic-soaked crumbs, Hector declares that he is a huge fan of Steely Dan (the band, not William S. Burrough’s prop that, er, electrifies the masterful <em>Naked Lunch</em>).</p>
<p>And I say to him (YES WITH MY MOUTH FULL BECAUSE THIS POINT IS <em>THAT</em> IMPORTANT) “Sure, right, you’re a big Steely Dan fan. But does your library have ‘Everyone’s Gone to the Movies (Demo Version)’?</p>
<p>And he stares down at his fancy Italian leather shoes and you can see his face turn the slightest shade of <em>primavera</em> red, and being the kinda guy who doesn’t want to embarrass friends and waiters, I said, “Hey Nineteen, don’t feel Deacon blue.” Two quick song title references helped lighten the mood up a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2017/10/13/steely-dan-walter-becker-peg-aja-670103.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peg</a>. “I can show you how you can complete your collection in like 60 seconds.”</p>
<p>Hector’s all like, “You’re on.” (But he says it with an Italian accent, because you know, this is a really nice Italian restaurant where everyone speaks with an Italian accent). He continues, “I’ve Plexed my van. It’s out back.”</p>
<p>I say “Oh, you mean like <em>now</em>, now?”</p>
<p>“Yup. I’ve got 60 seconds before table 12 gets their <em>spumoni</em>.” And then he drops his voice a whole 12 tone octave, and says in a gravelly Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Western sort of way: “Or is your whole ‘Plex is the greatest ultra-hi-fidelity music augmentation experience the world has ever known’ claim just a bunch of marketing bunk?”</p>
<h3>A mid-meal wager is placed</h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it was on. And that’s how approximately 22 seconds later, I found myself in Hector’s van betwixt my <em>primo</em> and <em>secondo</em>. I told my dining companion to pick out a nice victory red from the wine list whilst I was away. That’s how real this just got.</p>
<h3>Yes, I got into the van</h3>
<p>Now, don’t worry &#8211; this van was one of those strangely nice Sprinter style vans that had been retrofitted into a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vanlife/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#vanlife</a> sort of vibe that you see popping up on the Instagrams of ultra-hip and attractive people who are also seemingly deeply under-employed. Rest assured, Hector had a halfway decent wifi connection, as well as a rather <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stupid-ipad-accessories-2012-5#a-maxi-pad-for-your-ipad-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impressively decorated</a> iPad Air.</p>
<p>So, just to be clear, despite the preceding set up, it was <strong>not</strong> weird. Or at least, not <em>that</em> weird. Now, did Hector have a few pet reptiles in his van? Maybe yes. But putting Hector in jeopardy with <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/64/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Customs</a> for the unlicensed importation of exotic reptiles is not the point of this post. It’s the transformation of Hector’s Plex music library (and by extension his entire way of life) in a scant 60 seconds – <em>that’s</em> the point of this post. So let’s stop obsessing about the little purple chameleons, okay?</p>
<p>Pulling out a suspiciously placed old-timey stop watch from his trouser pocket, Hector nodded to me, and said, “Do your thing, magic man.” Now to be clear, that’s not my <em>actual</em> name, but given that I was on the clock, I didn’t want to waste time clarifying my bona fides. We had a library to augment and a mind to blow, after all.</p>
<h3>Enter an ocean of music</h3>
<p>So, first thing we did after Hector started his big nickel-plated <a href="https://newatlas.com/birthday-200th-stopwatch/43431/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stop watch</a> (that looked exactly like the one from <em>60 MINUTES</em> that you see before Andy Rooney starts to rant about how he can never find a stapler when he’s in the bathroom) was to launch the Plex app on his iPad.</p>
<p>Cool, we’re just 4 seconds in and already halfway there. Then I said, “Okay, show me The Dan.” And he navigated to his Steely Dan collection for me, and if I could just give Hector some props, it was an IMPRESSIVE display of custom album art. He was truly a master curator. Okay, enough with the praise, I got a <em>secondo</em> to start.</p>
<p>His Steely Dan library prior to massive Plex augmentation looked like this:</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11674 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1024x768.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-300x225.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-768x576.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1800x1350.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1440x1080.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-800x600.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-640x480.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-400x300.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-150x113.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag.png 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>And then while he was talking about that one time he <em>almost</em> met Shag at a gallery in Silver Lake, I told Hector to go to <a href="https://www.plex.tv/music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plex.tv/music</a> and click on the <strong>Get 30 Days Free</strong> button to activate his TIDAL x Plex trial. He shot me a classic left eyebrow arch and asked the timeless question: “Bro, you sure?”</p>
<p>And I said to him, “<em>Absolument, mon frère.</em>” Which isn’t Italian because I took French in high school, but he got the gist anyway. “First month is free, so if it doesn’t turn you on, you can always turn it off. No harm, no foul.”</p>
<h3>Hungry for a FLAC attack</h3>
<p>So, on the Plex <a href="https://www.plex.tv/music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, Hector chose the HiFi edition for his free trial, which delivers something like sixty million tracks in FLAC format, plus 250,000 music videos.</p>
<p>I smiled: “Check out your new Dan, man.”</p>
<p>And lo and behold gentle reader, when his Steely Dan page refreshed (remind you, we’re only at 18 seconds into this 60 second challenge), he saw this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11663" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steely-dan-add-to-library.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hector gave me a look that said, “Oh my ever-loving god, what black magic is this?” I shot him back a look that implied, “Oh, I guess you just completed your collection with a single click.”</p>
<h3>I casually Venn-diagrammed the concept of awesomeness</h3>
<p>And now we’re at 24 seconds, so I decided to do a little showboating. “Scroll past the TIDAL ALBUMS and you’ll see PLEX RECOMMENDATIONS ON TIDAL.” Hector pondered the list. “Wait. That’s not Steely Dan. Who are these guys? ”</p>
<p>By way of response, I held onto his shoulder, stuck my arm in front of both of us, and did that majestic hand-sweeping-thing in front of his face like Howard Hughes introducing the Spruce Goose: “These are all the artists who <em>sound</em> like Steely Dan but&#8230;” and this <em>but</em> was so significant i had to say it twice, “&#8230; but <em>you</em> don’t have in <em>your</em> library. Yet.” I enunciated the final word in my best movie trailer voice. We both shivered. But it could have been his wicked powerful sub-arctic AC he modded his van with.</p>
<p>Seriously, is he transporting organs in this thing?</p>

<p>And then at 35 seconds into this process of meta-musical transcendence (it was Easter Sunday after all), I said, “Go ahead and click on Discovery Radio button. This is the music that is guaranteed <em>not</em> to be in your library, but similar to the songs that <em>are</em> already in your library. It’s like discovering a parallel universe of music that you already love.”</p>

<p>He whispered to me like we’ve finally laid eyes on a golden Idol hidden in the far reaches of a spider-infested cave, “So I can get my Dan on <em>without</em> listening to Steely Dan?” And I do that classic move where I create a Venn diagram out of a handy set of tropical mango-scented Sharpies. “Think of Discovery Radio as your favorite band’s favorite tracks – that you’ve never heard of.”</p>
<p>“My favorite’s favorites…” muttered Hector. And I chuckled knowingly to myself: Hombre, we haven’t even begun to explore the cosmos of augmentation possibilities.</p>
<h3>Can an augmented music library actually win back your ex-girlfriend? We report, you decide</h3>
<p>I continued to take him down the rabbit hole with me. “Now get ready for some brand new features we’re launching this week on Android mobile &amp; TV, Apple TV, iPhone and iPad, according to <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/add-tidal-content-to-your-plex-music-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the details on our support site</a>.” In a burst of anticipation, Hector raised his eyebrows like two fuzzy caterpillars, which immediately caught the attention of his little chameleon friends. It was cute and weird all at the same time &#8211; such is #vanlife I suppose.</p>
<p>I continued, “Go to an artist that you’ve only added one album from, probably because your ex-girlfriend’s boyfriend says he was kinda into them that one time you ran into the two love-birds at the <a href="https://www.travelchannel.com/interests/shopping/articles/worlds-best-flea-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flea Market</a> and you just wanted to see what kinda stuff this new guy was made of.”</p>
<p>And Hector said with grim determination, “Yeah. That’d be The Mars Volta.”</p>
<p>I thought to myself, man you are <em>never</em> winning your ex-girlfriend back from a guy with strong music taste like that, but I kept this insight to myself because that’s not <em>my</em> journey in life, nor my quest in the back of this van. To reiterate: my singular goal is to expand minds and augment libraries. And so that’s what I did.</p>
<p>“Cool. <em>Now</em> look up that Mars Volta in your new augmented Plex, and <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Get_Schwifty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show me what you got</a>.” And Hector did so and grinned like he’s just made a hole-in-one in the golf course of life. “Instantly add a few of those deep cuts to your library and blast them outside your ex-girlfriend&#8217;s house sometime.” And he looked at me and said “Add them?” And I was all like, “Yep. You can now <em>add</em> albums from TIDAL right to your native Plex library.”</p>
<h3>And now all eyes turn to thee, Artist TV</h3>
<p>And before he could even process that wizardry, I one-upped myself by hitting him with yet another crazy super-power we’re launching this week. “So you know how you got your Artist Radio? Well <em>now</em> you got Artist TV too on Android mobile &amp; TV, Apple TV, iOS devices.”</p>
<p>He was like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4dZCUtq-yI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>what the freak</em></a>? And even though we only had 12 seconds remaining, I said, “Yep, turn it on and crank it up!” And then boom, he had Steely Dan TV, right there in his van. It’s like <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/most-memorable-moments-from-total-request-live/brandon-michaels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Total Request Live</a> from the old days, but instead of being in Times Square with the dangerously low energy Carson Daly, it’s now in the palm of your hand. Or on the wall of your home. Or on the front of your, uh, tablet. Anyway, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/apps-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you get the picture</a>.</p>
<p>You could say Hector’s jaw dropped. Because it did. Which is why you can say that. Because this post, my friends, is 100% fact-based journalism. The features by which Hector’s Steely Dan-loving mind were blown are available to you as well. Just try it out. And might I repeat our mantra? If it doesn’t turn you on, you can always turn it off.</p>

<h3>About that victory glass of red wine…</h3>
<p>So as I slid back into the restaurant booth, our Branzino arrived (bone-in because it’s that kinda joint) and I smiled at my dining companion. If only she knew the magical worlds Hector and I had just spelunked through in the van.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not an April Fool’s story, nor is it a tale powered by 420, nor even is it a special top secret <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-technology-do-you-think-the-US-government-is-currently-hiding-from-the-public-and-what-are-examples-of-previously-classified-technologies-that-were-later-declassified-and-sold-in-civilian-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">government weapons-grade robotic augmentation project</a> that your mighty tax dollars are funding. Nope. It’s just the same awesome Plex you use and love every month of the year. And now especially in April.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re thrilled to announce that our new big-screen interface is now available for Roku users in the Roku channel store, and it’s also now available as a <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/apple-tv-beta-with-uno-ui/393124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta for Apple TV</a>!</p>
<p>The new UI represents months of hard work, extensive user testing, and ongoing conversation with our community. It’ll continue to be a focus of our efforts as we work to bring the new conventions to our other big-screen and mobile apps, but we’re super happy with the reception to date. Want to know more about how we got here? Read on, and we’ll give you the backstory…</p>

<p>The UI in our apps has been through a few major changes in its time. These have been driven by the shifting needs of the Plex ecosystem, which has become increasingly vast and feature-rich over the years.</p>
<p>These transitions can be a little painful for some, and (believe us!) we do our very best to balance the needs of everyone from the most intense Plex-head running seven servers in their closet (we know you’re out there!) to your grandma or roommate who just wants to check out the odd episode of Friends from time to time (I’m told it didn’t age well). Sometimes we’ve managed to nail these transitions perfectly, and sometimes, unfortunately, we haven’t.</p>
<p>If you’re old enough to remember Plex’s <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/release-007-let-there-be-mini-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">embryonic form OSXBMC</a>, you’ll remember those were simpler times. You plugged a hard drive into your Mac Mini, your Mini into your only TV, stuck your media on that sucker, and played away. There was no server. Our phones still had keypads. These were dark days.</p>

<p>As it became clear that the Future was going to be multi-screened, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/the-road-to-plexnine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we created the Plex Media Server</a>, and turned OSXBMC into a lightweight app which could access it. There’s no question this was a Good Move, but hey, it added some complexity. We stuck with it, our lovely community of dedicated Plexians stuck with it, and I think you’ll agree we’re all better off.</p>
<p>When we introduced our <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/introducing-myplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">service in the cloud</a> (anyone remember “myPlex”?), it unlocked some pretty awesome capabilities. Now you could easily stream from anywhere, and it meant you could share your stuff with family and friends. Pretty spiffy, but our apps were built under the assumption that you had one local server available to you. Shared stuff was all sort of shoehorned off into a corner of the app, and if you wanted to browse it, you got a big flat list. Not so great. So we undertook a redesign effort that we internally thought of as “server-first”—now you could pick the server you wanted to browse, and when you did, you got a first class experience. Again, this introduced a little bit of complexity for some folks who really did have a single, local server. So it wasn’t without its tradeoffs, but again, in the end we think it was worth it.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and we wanted to start dipping our toes in some new streams of content (see what I did there?) that we could bring to all of you wonderful folks in a first class way, as well as people who didn’t have their own server at all. We also realized that it was more likely that you’d have more server-based sources available. Both of these realities posed a challenge to our “server-first” navigation. Streaming content, of course, wasn’t coming from a traditional media server, and navigating between servers was fairly painful. In fact, why should you need to think about servers at all when you should be able to just find the thing you want and play it? (It’s an important factor, of course, but it shouldn’t get in the way.)</p>
<p>As a way of taming the growing number of sources, some of which lived in the cloud, we devised a UI navigation scheme that we referred to internally as “type-first”. That is, you pick the type of media you’re looking for (“I’d like to watch a movie”), then pick from a (smaller) number of sources that contain that type of media. In the end, it was well-intentioned and it solved a few things nicely for many folks, but it also introduced a great deal of friction for some. Based on all the feedback (both internal and external), we went back to the drawing board in search of a better approach.</p>
<p>Internally, we refer to the new effort as “UNO”, since bringing a unified, consistent experience to all platforms and devices is one of the core objectives. A few others include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Restoring some basic usability qualities that suffered a bit under “type-first”. Fewer clicks to get where you want to go. More discoverable actions and sources. More intuitive gestures and navigation. Fewer distractions with things you shouldn’t have to care about.</li>
<li>Ownership and customization. You have complete control over your navigation—you tell Plex what you care about, we build an experience for you, and if you don’t like it, you can rearrange sources, hide sources, and more.</li>
<li>Improved functionality in a multi-source world. Features like Search need to work perfectly to deliver exactly the results you want.</li>
<li>At the core of the experience is the sidebar. In addition to being a better use of screen space than the top menu, it lets you see all the stuff you care about, and none of the stuff you don’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Well, it&#8217;s almost here again. That day when our nation&#8217;s finest technical minds are focused, laser-like, on fake product announcements and promo videos to match. It&#8217;s not as if we haven&#8217;t been guilty in the past. Some may remember <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/happy-april-fools-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Rickroll of 2013</a>. Clearly one of our finest moments.</p>
<p>But 2019 is all about empowering our loyal friends. Our tireless server admins. The ones who toil day after day on behalf of their own loving friends and family. Ask yourselves: isn&#8217;t it time you give the Gift of Rick?</p>
<p>Since we want folks to be able to get things set up and in place before the 1st, we are letting you know about this today. If you have an active Plex Pass subscription, all you need to do is grab the latest <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass Server beta release</a> and check the &#8220;April Fools 2019&#8221; setting under <em>Settings &gt; Extras</em> (if you already installed the beta release and don’t see the setting, try restarting your server) and we&#8217;ll take care of the rest. On April 1st your shared users will get a very special Rickroll before the first movie they play that day; it has an emoji heart and everything!<br />
<img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plex-enable-rickroll-snippet-300x88.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11602 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plex-enable-rickroll-snippet-300x88.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plex-enable-rickroll-snippet-400x117.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plex-enable-rickroll-snippet-150x44.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plex-enable-rickroll-snippet.jpg 634w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><br />
I know it’s been a while since we’ve blogged, but on a more serious note (and not wanting to give too much away) April is going to be massive for us on several platforms. Stay tuned. There are seriously awesome things to come.</p>
<p>&#8230; and good luck getting that song out of your head! Rick and Roll!</p>

<p>One neat thing is that the server has actually been collecting data for quite some time in anticipation of this feature, so if you’ve been running a server for a while, you can actually dive back about <em>three years</em> in the media consumption graph.</p>

<p>We already have more enhancements planned to show full view history, the ability to click through to see which four people played <em>Frozen</em> 97 times, etc. Stay tuned. The Dashboard will evolve, and eventually become sentient. Don&#8217;t say we didn&#8217;t warn you.</p>
<p>You’ll need the latest version of the Plex Media Server (v1.14.1 or newer) and our web app (v3.81.1 or newer; available now in our <a href="https://app.plex.tv/desktop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hosted web app</a> and coming to the bundled server version soon) to see all this deliciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Sleighs and Subtitles</strong><br />
We’ve also been working on improvements for subtitles, another feature that&#8217;s super important to many of you. We&#8217;ve made big improvements to the reliability of <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/subtitles-and-sunsets-big-improvements-little-housekeeping/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">subtitles-on-demand</a>—if you haven&#8217;t tried it recently, give it another shot and let us know how it&#8217;s working for you. We’re also in the process of adding more management features for Plex Pass holders like offset adjustment (available now on Apple TV), as well as manually importing and deleting subs (iOS and Android mobile). Those features will of course be spreading across all our apps.</p>

<p><strong>Enhanced Players</strong><br />
We&#8217;ve touched on this a bit in <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/turning-plex-music-up-to-eleventy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous posts</a>, but we&#8217;ve made some massive improvements to our audio player on mobile platforms, and the video player on iOS and Apple TV. We know the ability to direct play media is important to you, and even though it required a total gutting of the player stack (which is not a small deal), we&#8217;re making great progress. Forget about gapless (<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Babytown%20Frolics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">babytown frolics</a>), have you even heard Sweet Fades, bro? HAVE YOU EVEN DIRECT PLAYED MKV ON YOUR APPLE TV? NO!? Go ahead. We&#8217;ll be here when you get back from having your mind blown. Direct play can make a huge difference for low-powered servers (so much so that we’ve heard <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/an-inconvenient-bug-or-two/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Al Gore</a> might be presenting us with some sort of award in Oslo), but it also makes life much better even on more powerful servers with super fast startup and seeking.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It will come as no surprise to any long-time reader of this humble publication that we here at Plex are pretty sweet on media. While you might think of us as being focused on media inside your home, we’ve always had an interest in media streaming from that fabulous assortment of cloudy pipes we call the Internet. </p>
<p>The first phase of this interest was Plex Plugins. Although fun to write, they never supported much of the rich library functionality we’ve added over the years, and they also required you to run a server. This notion of needing to run a server at home to access media from the Internet just doesn’t make a lot of sense, which is one of the reasons <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/subtitles-and-sunsets-big-improvements-little-housekeeping/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">we’re retiring them</a>.</p>
<p>The second phase came with <a href="https://www.plex.tv/news-podcasts/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plex News</a> and our recent launch of <a href="https://www.plex.tv/news-podcasts/podcasts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plex Podcasts</a>. We developed a powerful and flexible platform for delivering online media using an API nearly identical to the media server, which is awesome for a few reasons—it&#8217;s a small step (not a giant leap) for apps that are used to talking to Media Servers to support Podcasts and more, and we’ve achieved near-feature parity between online content libraries and their homebound kindred spirits. Podcasts and Plex are a great combination: an enormous trove of incredibly awesome content (OK, and some questionable content) mated with our rich media platform on just about any screen (or speaker) you’d care to use.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce the third phase of our master plan for galactic domination: Web Shows (in beta). In a nutshell, we’ve partnered with a number of media producers to bring you high-quality episodic video content inside Plex! We’ve seeded our catalog with lovely, curated shows from only the highest quality creators; no robotic “top ten life hacks” or sparkly slime spam, and we’re looking forward to growing our catalog with your help. We have the best shows from amazing publishers like Condé Nast, Bonnier Corp., Fandor, Future, TWiT, Jukin, and Studio 71, including shows from Saveur, GQ, Field and Stream, PC Gamer, and Engadget and many more to come.</p>
<p>We’ve always worked to bring you a beautiful, distraction-free experience for your media. Gorgeous interfaces for presenting media in the loveliest way, a marked lack of crazy comment threads, and abundant options for personalization. And now you can enjoy all that is Plex with a bunch of great new content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year it seems like we’ve had extraordinarily weird news. With many upset that Boaty McBoatface was overturned, Trainy McTrainface has risen like a Phoenix born from the ashes of its predecessor. What else? There were enough Flat Earth truthers to unite for a conference, and DMX just released his long-awaited remix of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. I could go on, but it makes me wonder what I’m being distracted from. What’s the REAL scoop? Between being both entertained and horrified by news this year, it’s as important as ever to stay informed and we’re glad you agree.</p>
<p>Since rolling out Plex News in September, we’ve seen a steady growth in the number of users enjoying it. We appreciate the support you’ve shown us in bringing content to Plex and we’ve been listening to your feedback on how to make it even better.</p>

<p>So what’s new?</p>
<ul>
<li>For starters, we’ve broadened our support. Plex News is available on Android TV, NVIDIA SHIELD, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Roku, Android Mobile, iOS, and on our web app. Now you can enjoy news bites from culinary adventures to natural disasters, and more. As always, we’ll continue to bring support to other platforms.</li>
<li>We’ve pulled a few levers and re-adjusted our highly scientific news content calibrations to feature more content in each news category, less video duplicates of a popular story, and an overall more balanced experience.</li>
<li>Plex News is in good company: we’ve been able to introduce more content with the Associated Press (AP), Reuters, and Local Now. AP boasts coverage from breaking news to investigative reporting in over 100 countries. Similarly, Reuters is the world’s largest international multimedia news provider. Local Now provides <em>hyperlocal</em> weather, traffic, news, and sports reports.</li>
<li>We’ve made News <em>faster</em> (half seconds add up!) and improved overall performance with miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Want more control over what you see? Want to keep your Plex setup unsullied from the dystopian news of 2017? With a new Plex account setting that lets Plex Home admins enable news for their Managed Users or for other accounts to disable News visibility altogether across their apps, you now have more control over what you see.</span></li>
</ul>
