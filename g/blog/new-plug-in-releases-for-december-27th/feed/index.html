					<description><![CDATA[MTV UK is forcing view type on all menus to be 502 and not remembering when i change it upon restart. 

Videos are very clear compared to MV US but i must be out of the pop loop cuz i hardly know any of the artists in top 100  :-)

Should be called MTV international since its working without VPN in Czech rep.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The MTV UK plugin is just great. There are no problem (Video or audio) playing the music videos in Denmark, and the video and audio quality is just brilliant, allthough most of the video are not full size.
But I wonder why I only can play two music vedios in a row? If I start playing from a album/folder or my favorites/queue then only two music numbers are played.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just thought I would throw a big thank you for the MTV plugin...my daughter loves it already, so it&#039;s a big hit.

My only negative on it so far, is that it seems to take anything between 1 and 3 minutes to load a vid.  I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s my connection as I&#039;m running at about 6.5mbps at the moment with all other plugins running fine.

Apart from that, I&#039;m LOVIN it!

Thanks Sander.]]></description>
