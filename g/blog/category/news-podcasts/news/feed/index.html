										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re rolling out an awesome addition to your balanced media diet: Plex News. It’s the perfect complement to your media library — video news from some of the most trusted sources on the planet, presented beautifully and seamlessly alongside your own media. And because Plex is all about <em>your</em> media <em>your</em> way, you can personalize your news feed, and our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advanced AI</a> learns what you like and gets smarter the more you watch (since it’s just a robot, it’ll never mock your obsession with the Kardashians or insatiable appetite for stories about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/local/weather/kitten-saved-from-hurricane-harvey-flood-waters/2017/08/28/00efbf54-8c13-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_video.html?utm_term=.12d0c7bfa897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kittens being rescued from floods</a>).<br />

There’s so much amazing media available today that you’d be forgiven for taking in an entire season of Game of Thrones or the whole Marvel cinematic universe (once you figure out the order) without coming up for air. But it turns out some pretty crazy stuff is happening every day in the<em> real</em> universe, too, and we think it’s more important than ever to provide balanced news coverage from a variety of trusted and reliable sources. If Plex were a nutritious media breakfast, it’s kind of like eating your Wheaties. But with less carbs. Those things will kill you.</p>
<p>Starting with our recent <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/we-have-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition of Watchup</a>, we’ve worked hard to partner with the most reputable and trustworthy news sources around the world to bring you coverage from a wide variety of viewpoints. We have over 190 global publisher partners (and growing!), including international sources, like CNN, CBS, Financial Times, and Euronews, and local news sources for over 80% of markets in the US. We also have regional content for many other countries and we’re continually adding new sources. So whether you’re a #woke hipster or an <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old man yelling at a cloud</a>, we’ve got something for you.<br />
<img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-6708 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plex-news-logos-1-800x491.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plex-news-logos-1-800x491.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plex-news-logos-1-300x184.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plex-news-logos-1-768x471.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plex-news-logos-1-1024x628.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plex-news-logos-1-1800x1104.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plex-news-logos-1-1440x883.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plex-news-logos-1-640x392.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plex-news-logos-1-400x245.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plex-news-logos-1-150x92.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
Plex News is especially exciting to us because it follows a progression we started with Live TV and DVR where we’re bringing you great media from outside your library in a way which integrates seamlessly and beautifully. This makes it easier than ever to start using Plex if you’re new, and gives you another universe of content to explore outside of your own media, without ever leaving Plex.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you all know, media is our lifeblood. For the better part of a decade, we&#8217;ve been working obsessively and tirelessly to craft the best media platform on the planet (before it&#8217;s destroyed in a tweet gone wrong). This is why it gives us great pleasure to announce that we&#8217;ve acquired the streaming news service Watchup.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-800x488.jpg" alt="Plex acquires Watchup" class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-6065 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-800x488.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-768x468.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-1024x624.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-1800x1098.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-1440x878.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-640x390.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-400x244.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-150x91.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>If the last year has taught us anything, it&#8217;s that news is a very important part of our media diet. Especially as a cord-cutter, as many of you are, it can be challenging to find that nourishment, like when you hide kale from a hipster.</p>
<p>A few months ago, we introduced the awesome new <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/dvr/">Plex DVR</a>, which gives people an incredibly simple way to suck content out of thin air (or cable) and store it in their libraries. We were able to leverage many aspects of our platform in order to provide you with features and ease of use not found elsewhere. <span style="font-weight: 400">This kind of awesome, unified experience just isn&#8217;t possible for others, and we&#8217;re going to be building on that as we move forward to bring news media to you in a holistic manner within Plex!</span></p>
<p>Why Watchup? Well, they have a super talented engineering group who has built a remarkable system with advanced machine learning which processes local, national, and international news to generate a feed personalized just for you. Just as importantly, they have partnered with over 150 publishers, including a number who have invested in the company.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to welcome all of the employees of Watchup (another fully remote company!) to our merry band of Plex makers. They are a wonderful group of people who are just as passionate about news as we are about media (and kale). Barkley can&#8217;t wait to meet them all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s some new stuff for you to enjoy in the Plex App Store today. First of all, we have a plug-in for the popular Daily Kos site. If progressive politics if your thing, you&#8217;ll likely enjoy this one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;padding:10px"><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/untitled11.png" alt="untitled.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">If you prefer to get your politics directly from the White House, Chris Tarczon (author of the popular IGN plug-in) wrote a plug-in which gives you access to Obama&#8217;s weekly addresses (in HD!) and other White House content.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;padding:10px">
<img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/untitled12.png" alt="untitled.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And for those of you who don&#8217;t care a whit about (American) politics, but like your rock indie flavored, install the Pitchfork TV plug-in, which provides access to a *ton* of content, including band interviews, live performances, music videos, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;padding:10px"><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/untitled10.png" alt="untitled.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We&#8217;ve also released an update to the CNET plug-in so that the &#8220;Today on CNET&#8221; section actually reflects the current date.</p>
