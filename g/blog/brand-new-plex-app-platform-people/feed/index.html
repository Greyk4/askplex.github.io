@Alan: The new Plex channel can access all the same content as the previous one. That includes &quot;Collections&quot; you might have created in the library (just go into the full library and filter by the desired Collection) or playlists. If you&#039;re running on an older Roku device, it might have issues with the new channel (https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204151098-What-models-are-supported-for-the-Plex-for-Roku-channel-). The old channel is also still available, though it&#039;s no longer supported or in development: https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/208016997-Why-are-there-both-Plex-and-Plex-Classic-channels-]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are you going to fix the roku version? It worked fine until the mandatory update/upgrade. Now nothing works. It won&#039;t play 80% of my collection, It freezes, It locks up my roku, It won&#039;t let me see collections I have made. The version before this update was solid and amazing (I praised it to all I the people I know). Now I would not even recommend it. Can you please make the old version available. I have so..... many hours of work getting set the way I wanted it and overnight it was all destroyed. Please bring back the functional version.]]></description>

@Robb: The home screen has &quot;Recently Added&quot; hubs for each media type, including movies. So, you can access recently added movies from the home screen. You can also select the movie library, choose &#039;All Movies&#039; on the left, and then view all your movies. At the top there, you can filter and sort the content as desired (including sorting by date added). In the next update (already submitted to Roku), your filter/sort selection will also be remembered next time you enter the library. You could also filter/sort as desired in the web app (including sorting by date added) and save that as a smart playlist, which can be accessed on the Roku.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there. Am a huge fan of the entire range of plex applications. However, the new version for Roku I find infuriating each time I attempt to use it. 99% of the time I run it, I want to see my movies sorted by &#039;most recently added&#039;. If that feature is still present, it is masterfully hidden away. Please just give me a filter for the display type (by release date, or added date, or alphabetical) and then a sort toggle for newest to oldest or vice versa. I really can&#039;t stand the new UI flow...at all. I think it&#039;s terrible. The old UI was 100% more usable.]]></description>

@audeo: Search functionality (along with lots of other features and fixes) is already added in an updated version that&#039;s been submitted to Roku. It&#039;s just waiting for Roku to complete their review; we don&#039;t have any information about when that will be. In the meantime, you can always search using a mobile app (e.g. Android, iOS, Windows Phone) and then fling the content to Plex on the Roku.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to say that the new roku app is extremely disappointing. The lack of search functionality makes it just about useless for my family. with a few thousand movies, tv episodes, audio books and home movies in it, it is extremely hard to find anything. I have a lot of stuff that is not named correctly according to your naming schemes but used to be easy to find with a search. My wife and children spend a lot of time frustrated trying to find their favorite movies and stuff and it has made my life hell trying to help them. I have spent hours over the last week or two trying to find the search function in the new interface and only after coming here and reading this blog did I find out you hadn&#039;t even included the feature in the new version which updated automatically without asking me if I wanted it. I was a paid subscriber for the roku app and again feel really disappointed in the serious lack of functionality in the new app. 

I guess you can tell by the tone of my post that I am just increadably frustrated at this point. This was a product we used spread out over the whole family 4 or 5 hours a day if you added everyone together. Now everyone is trying to avoid it as we spend more time trying to find stuff than actually watching it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The UI looks great but there is one super annoying thing is how Unwatched works. Previously when you looked at unwatched tv shows hit play on the cover it started playing the next episode that was unwatched but now with the new it starts playing the oldest episode in the library even though it&#039;s been already watched. The only way to continue where you left off is to navigate down to the episode where you want to continue watching.]]></description>
