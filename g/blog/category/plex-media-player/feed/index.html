										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Um. Suffice it to say that a lot has happened since we last blogged a few months back. This may not be your typical Plex blog post, but it’ll probably be one of the least crazy things to happen today. </p>
<p>Quite a few of you have reached out to share how much Plex has helped over the past weeks and how it fits in to your shelter-in-place regimen, whether it’s keeping kids from tearing each other’s hair out, or keeping family and friends fed with a steady stream of media to pass the time. To be clear, we’re on the far fringes of being able to make a meaningful contribution to returning things to normal. While we’re not working on the cure*, we’re incredibly honored to know that we’re working on something that may make the mitigation a little more tolerable for all of you. It gives us a renewed sense of purpose. We won’t let you down.</p>
<h3>28 <del>Days</del> <del>Hours</del> Minutes Later</h3>
<p>This isn’t a Hands Across America sort of post—no false platitudes. For us, the reason we built Plex was that we always loved getting lost in stories. Movies and TV shows, documentaries and anime, old favorites as well as wild new experiences. To share a personal guilty pleasure, in times like this we’re comforted by watching really bad, really stupid, “c’mon you can’t be seriously watching that” comedies. Other people curl up with a good zombie movie. Others binge all the reality shows that seemed so trite before but now just might be able to deliver a much-needed moment of zen. Whatever your go-to jam is, we hope you get a chance to take a break every now and again. Okay! Now on to the rest of our blog.</p>
<h3>First, if you’re an educator quickly adapting to online classes, Plex might be able to help<br />
</h3>
<p>To be clear, this is a bit of a stretch for us as we’re a relatively small company, but we have a platform that might be of value to educators out there. We are aware of a number of schools (and hospitals, churches, and even a submarine!) that have used Plex to stream licensed and teacher-generated videos in classrooms. We’ve recently helped a San Francisco Bay Area school that suddenly needed to figure out how to distribute this content remotely via tablets and web browsers. We were able to donate the costs associated with the remote software, as well as provide early access to a new feature we’re working on, single item sharing, so teachers can now share their playlists or specific content directly with their classes. If you’re an educational institution that may benefit from using Plex, email us details at <a href="mailto:edu@plex.tv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">edu@plex.tv</a> so we can understand what you are looking to do, assess the demand, and see how we might be able to help. </p>
<h3>A few tips on Remote Working, aka how to have a conference call in your kid’s closet</h3>
<p>From day one, we’ve been a completely remote company, working out the kinks of “working in your bedroom / dining room / garage / (hopefully sleeping) baby’s nursery” for the last 10 years. We’re spread across six different continents, so we’re well-versed in the tradeoffs of which time zone gets the short end of the stick to get up at 5 AM to make that conference call (sorry Team Australia). So at Plex, we’re all used to the hassle of video communication and with the paradise and the disaster that comes with working at home. For many of you, welcome to the new normal. If you’re new to the game, here’s <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/work-from-home?utm_source=plex&#038;utm_medium=plex-blog&#038;utm_campaign=plex-blog-this-is-fine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a great post with 47 specific WFH hacks</a> as well as a recent Forbes post (by our very own Keith Valory) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/03/25/communication-and-collaboration-the-keys-to-successful-remote-work/#6bba94212a0b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on setting up your business for WFH</a>.</p>
<h3>Okay, another thing. For the next 3 months, Live TV will be free—no Plex Pass required</h3>
<p>If you have an HD antenna and tuner, then now you can stream your free live TV to all your devices without Plex Pass through the end of June (DVR and other premium features still require a Plex Pass). And if you don’t, we got some of our hardware partners to offer them to Plex users <a href="https://www.plex.tv/ad/community-love-plex-fam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at a discount for a limited time</a>. You can stream reruns, new shows (treasure them!), news, or kids programming. Stream it all around your home or while you’re away. Maybe it will help educate, entertain, enlighten, or another e-starting-word. <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/live-tv-over-the-air-functionality-free-for-the-next-3-months/561368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Get the details here</a>. We’ve been working especially hard to fix lots of issues with Live TV based on thoughtful feedback from the community. Stay tuned for more details on that soon.<br />

<h3>(*) Other ways to help</h3>
<p>We’ll leave it to others more knowledgeable in your local communities and countries on how best to donate and support each other financially and emotionally. We do know many of you probably have some spare CPU and GPU cycles lying around, though, so we’d like to highlight an opportunity to put them to work with <a href="https://foldingathome.org/covid19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">folding@home</a> (feel free to join “<a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/249802" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Team Plex</a>” #249802 if you don’t already have a team). As they say, “Each simulation you run is like buying a lottery ticket. The more tickets we buy, the better our chances of hitting the jackpot.” So by all means, let’s go make some more lottery tickets.</p>
<h3>And if you’ve read this far, yes, we do have an Official Unofficial Plex Coloring Book for you to download</h3>
<p>The least we can do (and we mean that quite literally) is make a Plex coloring book. (Thanks again Team Australia!) After all the movies have been watched, board games have been played, podcasts have been, um, podded, and you get to that point of maximum boredom, we present to you the official unofficial Plex coloring book. Take your frustration out in colored pencil form. Print it out. Doodle. Draw. Or share your kid’s (or your) best efforts on Facebook or Instagram for a chance to earn some Plex swag. <a href="https://assets.plex.tv/marketing/coloring-book/plex-coloring-book-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.<br />

<h3>Togethertude</h3>
<p>So in closing, during this period of uncertainty, hopefully you’ve got some family with you, some friends, or at least on-screen companions reaching out from their own couches, a town, or a country over. Just know we’ll be joining you, finding a moment of escape and perhaps even the briefest but most delicious slice of joy. Stay safe out there (or more likely, in there). We’re here for you.</p>
<p>So what are your hacks for surviving indoors in this unusual new time? Let us know in the comments down below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aloha, Plexians! Hoping this blog post finds you well. We have a few things to discuss. Some of them may be controversial; but most are (hopefully) informative.</p>
<p>First of all, starting next week, we’ll be exclusive on the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/5/18295833/epic-games-store-controversy-explained" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>
<p>(Just kidding. Too soon?)</p>
<p>But for real: We have a brand new desktop app that we’re excited to show off! It has all the glorious player capability of Plex Media Player, plus an exciting new offline capability. We used to call it “Sync”, but now it’s just “Downloads” — a friendlier term that means it’s just a single click to take your favorite media with you, and you can find it all in one predictable place. It’s also built on a much simpler and more reliable mechanism, so downloads start quickly, and give clearer feedback along the way. It’s a bit of a sneak peek at the direction we’re headed with offline media across the board (including the mobile apps), so check it out and let us know how it works for you!</p>
<p>This new app is just called “Plex” — it’s the macOS and Windows equivalent of our other apps: your window to media greatness (even though this one’s supercharged with all the same server and library management capabilities of our web app). You can download the new <a href="https://www.plex.tv/downloads/#plex-app" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plex desktop app here</a>.</p>

<p>It’s almost midnight, a few hours before this post goes live, but we already hear you asking: What does this mean for the Windows Store app? Whither Plex Media Player? Whoa, whoa, slow down. Let’s take this one at a time. Also no one says “whither” anymore (even though it’s a super useful adverb… just sayin’).</p>
<p>First, the Windows Store app. It’s been a little broken for a while now. Back when we first started developing Windows apps, it made a ton of sense to embrace the ecosystem, but over time (<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Windows Phone <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) it made less and less sense to keep investing dedicated development resources to the Metro [sic] platform. We’d much rather invest the effort on a cross-platform app with a best-in-class player engine under the hood, so as of today we’re taking our Windows app out of the store. The new desktop app which replaces it has a much more capable player stack, support for all modern features, and finally a proper replacement for Sync. Just “Download” the media you want to keep available offline. The app itself is free for everyone, though offline (download) support still requires the server owner to have an active Plex Pass. Go forth and defenestrate!</p>

<p>EDIT: So, this next section used to talk about how we were ending support for Plex Media Player in six months, and with it, effectively ending support for HTPCs as a platform. We planned this with the best intentions. tl;dr, modern streaming devices provide a better experience for most people (the vast majority of you have already switched), and not spending energy maintaining PMP would mean we can focus more on making that experience better for everyone. Well, let’s just say that although their numbers are few, the PMP army speaks loudly, in mostly civilized voices, with the occasional conspiracy theory peppered in. So, we hear you, and we’re adjusting our plans a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will keep PMP in TV mode working as it is today and will fix serious issues which impact the product for the foreseeable future.</li>
<li>We will continue to invest in our player technology on streaming devices both to increase media compatibility, as well as to bring more “HTPC” features there (e.g. video zoom modes). We will also do a better job at communicating their capabilities, as it’s pretty hard to get an accurate picture of that. Look for more information on that soon!</li>
<li>We are now actively investigating the best way to continue supporting HTPCs as a platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for all your feedback, and for being awesome! Now on to the pithy conclusion of this blog post&#8230;</p>
<p><del datetime="2019-08-23T15:05:29+00:00">Second: Plex Media Player. The desktop “side” of the (admittedly Janus-esque) Plex Media Player will live on in the form of the new desktop app. For the TV layout lovers out there, we want to be clear about this: the long-term plan is for the new desktop app to replace Plex Media Player as our only desktop solution. The new desktop app is notably lacking TV mode, which means that we’re going to stop supporting the traditional HTPC setup (using a desktop computer connected to your TV or home theater) with this app. There. We said it. It marks the end of an era for us, and we’d be lying if we said it wasn’t a little bittersweet. But take heart. We looked at how most people were using the app, and most of you will have an equal (if not better) experience with a streaming device and our new players.<del datetime="2019-08-23T15:14:32+00:00"></p>
<p><del>Our new Apple TV and Android players support <em>nearly</em> all the same formats. And of course modern streaming devices don’t need as much care and feeding as desktop computers. They don’t need to sleep (much), they use a tiny amount of electricity (Al Gore made us say that) and they don’t require nearly as much effort to get up and running. They have remotes that work wonderfully out of the box (no more fiddly custom key mappings!) In short, they’re designed for the environment in which you’re using them, and it shows. We implore you to check out how far our apps and the various excellent streaming devices have come — it’s truly night-and-day since you unboxed your first potato-powered Roku or Apple TV.</del datetime="2019-08-23T15:14:32+00:00"></p>
<p><del>At the same time, we recognize there are some exceptions, so we will keep updating Plex Media Player until Jan 30, 2020 (you can find the <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/plex-media-player/120475/last" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">downloads here</a>).</del></p>

<img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tv-shows-1024x659.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12013 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tv-shows-1024x659.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tv-shows-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tv-shows-768x494.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tv-shows-1800x1158.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tv-shows-1440x926.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tv-shows-800x515.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tv-shows-640x412.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tv-shows-400x257.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tv-shows-150x97.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>So, in a nutshell: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/categories/windows-mac-desktop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brand new desktop app that includes offline capability</a>! End to the confusion around the Windows App Store app (<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />). (Gradual) end to the TV layout in PMP. And a gentle reintroduction to the word “whither.” Seriously though, take the next six months to pick up a connected device that fits your needs, wallet, and ecosystem of your choice.</p>
<p>In the next blog, we’ll cover topics such as “how hard the Epic Games Store blows, as told by angry Redditors,” “how we learned to stop worrying and love the connected device,” and a gentle reintroduction to word “whence.”</p>
<h3>Frequent questions</h3>
<h4>What about a Linux version?</h4>
<p>Right now, we&#8217;re focusing our resources on macOS and Windows to ensure they receive the best experience they can. It&#8217;s certainly possible that we could expand to support Linux in the future, but for now it&#8217;ll be Windows and macOS.</p>
<h4>Will you publish the app in the Microsoft Store?</h4>
<p>We don&#8217;t have any immediate plans to bring the new app to the Microsoft Store. That said, we&#8217;ve also definitely not ruled out that possibility. For now, the app is available from our <a href="https://www.plex.tv/downloads/#plex-app" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Downloads page</a> as a standard, Windows EXE installer.</p>
<h4>Why is the interface scale really small/wrong on my Windows setup?</h4>
<p>On Windows systems with non-standard scaling of the display, you may need to go manually adjust the Display Scale for the app. We <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/configuring-windows-display-scale/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have a support article</a> with instructions. We&#8217;re also working to improve that experience for users out of the box, to help avoid needing to do manual adjustments when possible.</p>
<p>Stay tuned. Barkley is on the edge of his proverbial seat.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago we <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/remastered-thanks-to-you-our-brand-new-tv-navigation-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spelled out</a> some imminent changes to our TV UI, and intimated that great things were to come across the board. “UNO is the future!” we said (“UNO” being our internal code name for the new UI paradigm across all platforms). None of us quite knew why “UNO” was capitalized since it’s not an acronym. “Blame Jason!” we said, and Jason was asleep at the time, so we went with it.</p>
<h3>So what is all this hullabaloo about UNO anyway?</h3>
<p>In case you missed it, UNO is our latest effort to streamline the process of searching, discovering and enjoying your content in your Plex library—no matter the type, no matter the source, no matter the format. It’s an easy, elegant, and powerful system that’s consistent no matter where and how you Plex. It gives you the ultimate control over how you navigate your collection.</p>
<h3>Benefits include: Niftier navigation</h3>
<p>We restore some basic usability qualities that suffered a bit under our “type-first” implementation.</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/navigating-the-big-screen-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fewer clicks to get where you want to go.</a></li>
<li>More discoverable actions and sources.</li>
<li>More intuitive navigation patterns.</li>
<li>Fewer distractions with things you shouldn’t have to care about.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A powerful new sidebar</h3>
<p>In addition to being a better use of screen space than the top menu, it lets you see all the stuff you care about, none of the stuff you don’t, and it gets out of the way when you don’t need to look at it.</p>
<h3>Rolling out wide across the Plexverse</h3>
<p>Fast forward a few months, and now we’re on the precipice of realizing that very vision: the UNO UI is rolling out across all TV platforms this week, it’s <em>super</em> close on iOS and coming thereafter on Android, but importantly this marks the mainstream release of our most sacred (and challenging!) release of all: our beloved Web app.</p>
<h3>Which brings us to our friendly neighborhood Web app</h3>
<p>The Plex Web app is a bit of a special beast, since it serves as both a super popular platform for consuming media and the singular app to admin and curate your Media Servers. We’re fairly confident this app embodies the best of both worlds: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-plex-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimate customization</a> for the media consumer and improved control and curation for the server owner and administrator. It’s always a fun balancing act between the two—and many thanks to everyone who has given feedback along the way.</p>

<p>So go forth and customize! Embrace the sources you love best! Relegate the others to the “More” menu! (It’s okay, I’m pretty sure they won’t be offended <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f937-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) The reins of your media future rest loosely in your hands… YAH!</p>

Well, it&#8217;s almost here again. That day when our nation&#8217;s finest technical minds are focused, laser-like, on fake product announcements and promo videos to match. It&#8217;s not as if we haven&#8217;t been guilty in the past. Some may remember <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/happy-april-fools-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Rickroll of 2013</a>. Clearly one of our finest moments.</p>
<p>But 2019 is all about empowering our loyal friends. Our tireless server admins. The ones who toil day after day on behalf of their own loving friends and family. Ask yourselves: isn&#8217;t it time you give the Gift of Rick?</p>
<p>Since we want folks to be able to get things set up and in place before the 1st, we are letting you know about this today. If you have an active Plex Pass subscription, all you need to do is grab the latest <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass Server beta release</a> and check the &#8220;April Fools 2019&#8221; setting under <em>Settings &gt; Extras</em> (if you already installed the beta release and don’t see the setting, try restarting your server) and we&#8217;ll take care of the rest. On April 1st your shared users will get a very special Rickroll before the first movie they play that day; it has an emoji heart and everything!<br />
<img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plex-enable-rickroll-snippet-300x88.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11602 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plex-enable-rickroll-snippet-300x88.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plex-enable-rickroll-snippet-400x117.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plex-enable-rickroll-snippet-150x44.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plex-enable-rickroll-snippet.jpg 634w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><br />
I know it’s been a while since we’ve blogged, but on a more serious note (and not wanting to give too much away) April is going to be massive for us on several platforms. Stay tuned. There are seriously awesome things to come.</p>
<p>&#8230; and good luck getting that song out of your head! Rick and Roll!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! This blog post is dedicated to you, the devoted user. The one who’s been with us since early days, meticulously curating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few terabytes</a> of media goodness. The one who would be happy to see us focus on stability and core functionality, and do a bit of house cleaning along the way.</p>
<p>For years now (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/rob-lowe-literally-ama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">li-ter-ah-ly</a>) you’ve have been asking for a way to get <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/subtitle-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtitles</a> without having to go back to the computer, submit to dubious popup ads, move the subs into place, refresh the media, get distracted by a half-eaten hoagie in the fridge. Sorry, where was I? Oh right, so we’re pleased to announce a feature which makes it so easy to find and enable a subtitle, <em>you don’t even have to leave the couch</em>. We use all sorts of smarts to find you the best matches in all sorts of languages (half of all Plexians are outside the US). <strong>This feature will be rolling out as Plex Pass Preview over the next few days</strong> as we fine tune it on Web Desktop, Xbox One, most LG TVs, Plex Media Player, Android mobile, and Android TV (iOS and Apple TV will follow up shortly).</p>

<em>Android TV</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plex has been around for the better part of a decade, and software has a way of behaving like your garage: You had every intention of keeping it neat and organized, but every nook is somehow filled with Star Wars figurines and Amiibos. So it’s critical to hold the occasional yard sale and get rid of all the accumulated cruft. It’s not an uncommon thing for a software company to do—Apple does it (et tu, OpenGL?), and so does Google (RIP Inbox, Reader).</p>
<p>The Plex ecosystem is quite large, and over the years, we’ve sometimes added things that might have made sense at the time, but didn’t age well. We’ve also been <em>incredibly</em> reluctant to take anything away from people who may be using a given feature. Or kill support for a platform with low usage or other challenges. And while any given case might not be significant, they can add up over a decade to a death by a thousand (paper) cuts. So we set out to do some house-cleaning&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn’t approach the process lightly; we looked over usage numbers and took into account maintenance costs and general customer satisfaction. In some cases, we have plans for a future in which a better replacement shows up. Other things, we’re just stabbing in the chest repeatedly with a wooden stake (and hoping it’s not a zombie). But the philosophy is the same—<em>we want to focus our finite energy on providing awesome functionality that works great and makes the folks who use it happy</em>. Without further ado, here’s the list of things we’re retiring:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Plugins</strong>: This was not a decision taken lightly, as they’ve been around for a long time, and we’ve had good times both writing and using them. But bluntly, hardly anyone uses them (less than 2% of users), the ancient protocol they use is a continued pain for clients to support, and if we were to build the feature again, we’d do it very differently in this day and age. For utility-type functionality, we love standalone apps like <a href="https://tautulli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tautulli</a> and believe this is a better approach. But don’t panic—while the Plugin Directory will soon be gone, you can still manually install plugins for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Watch Later</strong>: There’s a small handful of you who still care about this feature – just enough to form a close-knit support group – and we’re super sorry (really) if this disrupts your daily bookmarking, but the feature is costly for us to maintain, and hard to justify in the long run.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: There is very low usage, and it’s also built atop an antediluvian sync engine, so if you rely on Cloud Sync for your day-to-day, things aren’t pretty. DM us a photo of your Cloud Sync library and today’s newspaper and we’ll buy you a beer? (no, not really).</p>
<p>Lastly, as we’ve previously announced, we’re shuttering our hosted Plex Media Server in the cloud (Plex Cloud) as of November 30. For those of you who relied on the service, please accept our heartfelt apology.</p>
<p>So with all that house-cleaning out of the way, what else have we been doing with our newfound laser focus (and laser-equipped sharks? shh… that’s Phase Two)? A lot of good stuff, actually.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Making Sync Great <del datetime="2018-09-25T15:08:31+00:00">Again</del></strong>: We realize that over the years, our vaunted (and premium) offline sync feature hasn’t always worked as reliably as we would have hoped. We decided to form a Seal Team 6 style group tasked with assassinating as many sync bugs as they could, working with client and server groups, as well as with forum users. The team has already made great headway on fixing some of the most annoying bugs, and you’ll begin to see the fruits of their labor across the next wave of updates.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Making Players Play</strong>: We’ve convened a similar squadron of sauron-eyed swashbucklers to kill bugs in the new Android player engine. Yes, it’s awesome that it Direct Plays everything under the sun, but that doesn’t matter if it randomly stops playing Bachelor in Paradise right as Jenna is about to punch Jordan in the face. Also: that show is everything that is wrong about humans.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>The Sound of Music</strong>: Oh, and clamp down hard on your tuks, because we have some amazing music player improvements in the works. I don’t want to give too much away, but if it rhymes with schmapless, it may be coming to a platform near you. :mic-drop:</p>
<p>In conclusion, we’re working hard to improve our focus, spend time on things that matter the most, remove as many distractions as possible, improve stability of the core product, and launch more kick-ass features. Thanks for your feedback!</p>

<p>Remember those elves we hired to help us get our <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/beginning-look-lot-like-collections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday updates</a>, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-now-virtual-reality-daydream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases</a>, and <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/plex-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other cool stuff</a> out to you? Oh, we didn’t mention that? Well, now that you’re up to speed, we hired them back at a fraction of their normal cost. They also agreed to be referred to as henchmen, instead of elves, so long as we gave them a shout-out on this blog. <em>Seasonal work is a bitch, but now you get all of these updates:</em></p>

<p>Add another notch on the feature list making Xbox One an excellent choice to play your media using Plex. With live TV, switch between watching <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em> to getting your metaphorical ass handed to you on <em>PLAYERUNKNOWN&#8217;S BATTLEGROUNDS</em>. The elves were even thoughtful enough to add full time shifting so pause/play, rewind, and fast forward while you quest to refill your <span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mountain+dew" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>life force</em></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/roku-live-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live TV is nothing new for Roku</a>, but we’ve upgraded the experience to include a whole slew of features including full time shifting. What else can you expect when you watch Live TV on Roku? Take a look at the player controls and you’ll notice a current time/place marker now appears above the progress bar. There’s also an instant replay option for the times you can’t believe what you just saw. Finally, closed captioning is now available (for both DVR and Live TV) for our friends with hearing impairments.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the Xbox One debuted (almost four years ago!) it brought a few really innovative ideas to the home media world: lovely little clusters of media tailored to your interests, horizontally-scrolling lists as far as the eye could see, and the ability to <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/09/xbox-pizza-hut_n_4570898.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order a pizza</a> without moving a muscle. Needless to say we were quick to <s>steal</s> adapt some of the more compelling ideas for our own devices. (We even reached out to some of <a href="http://usedtobeapizzahut.blogspot.com/">these guys</a>, but they didn’t seem too interested, <em>for some reason&#8230;</em>).</p>
<p>A lot has happened since the early days. The Xbox team has been busy with their own redesigned dashboard and a new console, and it turns out we&#8217;ve been doing some innovating of our own: we&#8217;ve got a brand new, media-centric user interface that reflects our love for gorgeous metadata (posters! artwork!) as well as our passion for media browsing efficiency, and we&#8217;re bringing it to the Xbox One! We&#8217;ve got some great media discovery features where they make sense, and sensible, efficient grids everywhere else. Alas, we don&#8217;t have the ability to order a <em>Meat Lovers&#8217; with Extra Meat</em>, but we think it&#8217;s pretty tasty just the same. (And let&#8217;s be honest, these days true connoisseurs order their pizza with their voice assistant of choice.) Feast your eyes on the new goodness:</p>

<p>While we were sexying things up, we also threw in a few other improvements under the metaphorical hood:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mixed Photo/Video Libraries</strong><br />
Now, not only can you view all the unforgettable moments captured in your vacation photos, but you can watch the videos you took during the trip, too. All within the same library!</li>
<li><strong>Alexa Compatibility</strong><br />
Compatibility with Alexa means you can freely lose the remote into the deep abyss of couch cushions with wild abandon; just talk to her, already!</li>
<li><strong>Better Subtitle Compatibility</strong><br />
The app can now display many subtitle formats without using additional server resources. Enjoy faster playback and less whirring!</li>
<li><strong>Xbox Gamertags</strong><br />
Not sure you want everyone to know how long you&#8217;ve been playing <a href="http://www.goat-simulator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goat Simulator</a>? For the internet sleuths in your life, Plex accounts are no longer tied to your Xbox gamertags. There&#8217;s no need to link accounts, and you can enjoy your newfound freedom!</li>
</ul>

<p>This update is free for everyone using Plex on Xbox One, but don&#8217;t fret! We&#8217;re always working to improve all of our apps. The update will roll out automatically over the next few days, but If you&#8217;re too excited to wait, you can search for the &#8220;Plex for Xbox One&#8221; app in the Microsoft Store to manually install.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the beginning (A Long Time Ago), we have been passionate about user experience, and we’ve always tried to come up with innovative ways for you to interact with your media. It’s hard to believe it was almost <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/laika-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 years ago</a> when we introduced the On Deck feature, which gives you quick and efficient access to media by episode.<br />
<img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-6614 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plex-media-discovery-800x411.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plex-media-discovery-800x411.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plex-media-discovery-300x154.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plex-media-discovery-768x395.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plex-media-discovery-1024x527.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plex-media-discovery-1800x926.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plex-media-discovery-1440x740.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plex-media-discovery-640x329.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plex-media-discovery-400x206.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plex-media-discovery-150x77.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
Laika: Plex app and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space dog</a></p>
<p>On Deck was our first foray into what we call <i>media discovery</i>, where we try to find the golden needles in your media haystack, making it quick and easy to get to what you care about (e.g. the next episode in a TV series, or the movie you fell asleep watching the night before). In subsequent years, we’ve been working to bubble up other media suggestions, such as a show with new episodes you haven’t watched in a while, or an album you had on heavy rotation a few months ago. For <i>most</i> people, media discovery is great: it means that you never need to leave the home screen to find the next thing you want to watch or listen to. (And of course with post-play, you might never even need to <i>go back to the home screen in the first place!</i> Plex: The reason you were up until 4 a.m. watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Zoidberg</a> wax poetic over unrequited crustacean love.)</p>
<p>However, we’re keenly aware that all of our beloved Plex users weren’t cast from the same mold. Plenty of you want a simple, no-nonsense way to find a singular movie or TV show and play it with a minimum of fanfare. OR just scroll through their entire movie collection, page by page, to impress their dates (swipe right, scroll down!). Well, now you can finally rejoice: the brand new v2 UI means you’re no more than a click or two away from browsing your entire library. No need to pass Go, and (unfortunately?) no collecting $200.</p>
<p>A consistent Plex experience is also something we care deeply about. A few years ago, we (somewhat miraculously) got an XBox One app built (side note: we then hired the Microsoftie who helped us), and we fell deep and hard for the giant-posters-and-horizontal-navigation thing. The early Xbox One apps were trailblazers in their own right, but suffice to say that we were all searching for answers on the cusp of the next evolution of big-screen media apps.<br />

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>My god, it&#8217;s full of giant posters</i></a></p>
<p>The approach was beautiful in its simplicity: Lovely compositions built from your own media library! Giant thumbnails of your sex tapes (on certain unfortunate occasions)! Fields of [•••] buttons as far as the eye could see!</p>
<p>But it turns out there was a dark side&#8230;</p>
<p>There were clear issues with information density and click efficiency. Movie trailers languished in obscurity. Your favorite sources for media, especially across different servers, were often hard to get to.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we grew our UX team, and started doing real live “intimidation-based” user testing (the kind with one-way mirrors and ex-KGB handlers. Well, maybe just screen recording and kind volunteers, but that doesn’t sound nearly as cool.)</p>
<p>So back to the lab we went, and like Frankenstein with his monster&#8230;actually, that’s a terrible simile. Like the Manhattan Project with&#8230;nope, still not quite right. Like a postgraduate Chem student making meth in her bathtub, we sharpened our pencils, flipped open our notebooks to the first clean page, and got to work trying to appease our thesis advisor. (That’s you, everybody. Just go with it.)</p>
<p>We think this new approach is a great improvement for all of our users. Do you love and live by the discovery sword!? You’re covered. Do you prefer to browse your meticulously-curated movie collection in order and choose exactly what you want to watch? Also good to go, without wasted clicks. The new UI even adapts as you consume different types of media from different sources — no more switching “servers” between your own photos and your favorite hipster friend’s music library (weird that he refuses to add that new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHV3tyNQ60" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arcade Fire</a> album, no?)!</p>
<p>See, it turns out <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/699462-you-can-please-some-of-the-people-all-of-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lydgate</a> was full of shit: you CAN please all of the people all of the time. (Well, at least when it comes to two semi-conflicting modalities of media browsing.)</p>
<p>So without further ado, rest your weary eyes on some of this delicious, gluten-free eye-candy. This new interface is currently available in the Plex Pass preview version of Plex Media Player (don’t worry, it will be available to all our other users soon, too). Need more information?

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2016 has been a huge year so far in almost every corner of the Plexverse. All of our lovely client apps have gotten major features and upgrades. We&#8217;ve launched the first major step toward making your photos great again. The Media Server turned 1.0, grew a Streaming Brain and a DVR, and landed in some super cool places like Sonos, the NVIDIA SHIELD, a monster router from Netgear, and even The Cloud.</p>
<p>This is all fantastic news, of course, for our not-so-secret plans for world domination. However, today I want to talk about the platform that started it all: the home theater. Since we announced it a little over a year ago, the team behind <a href="https://www.plex.tv/apps/computer/plex-media-player/">Plex Media Player</a> has been hard at work ensuring the best possible media playback experience on a dizzying array of configurations. Squeezing full frame rate 4K video and high definition digital audio out of normal systems can be a challenge. Now try it with a Raspberry Pi. Controlled by an Atari 2600 joystick. Using the LCD on your fancy fridge for a display. (Okay, I made that one up, but I&#8217;m sure someone will try it and then take to our friendly forum when it drops a frame every 20 seconds&#8230;)</p>
<p>One considerably less obscure request is the desire to use the awesome power of the mpv playback engine everywhere. Maybe you pine for stuff like Plex Media Player&#8217;s silky smooth playback, complex subtitle rendering, and lightning fast seeking on your desktop. Maybe you have a lower-powered NAS server that doesn’t like to transcode. Or maybe you&#8217;d just like to rock out to some FLAC while you work. Until today, your only option was to find some place to stash a little baby Media Player window and muddle through the TV UI to queue up your background music of choice.</p>
<p>Well, no more: we&#8217;ve harnessed our incredibly powerful Web app and wrapped it up inside our lovely Plex Media Player shell to give you a full-fledged &#8220;desktop mode&#8221; experience right out of the box. With Plex Media Player running in a window, you can now use your mouse and keyboard as nature intended, and switching to the TV UI is as easy as going full-screen.</p>
<p>With this past year of fortification under the hood and the cool new desktop mode, we&#8217;re also taking this opportunity to make Plex Media Player available to everyone, 100% free, no Plex Pass required! Now you have no reason not to <a href="https://www.plex.tv/downloads/">download</a> and check it out!</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-5852 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-800x479.jpg" alt="image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-800x479.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-1024x613.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-768x460.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-1536x920.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-2048x1226.jpg 2048w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-1800x1078.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-1440x862.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-640x383.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-400x239.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-block-plex-media-player-tv-macbook-150x90.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Oh, and there is one more thing&#8230;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a home theater nut who&#8217;s been following along at home, you&#8217;ve probably heard of Kodi. Maybe you&#8217;ve even flirted with it (gasp!) as an alternative to Plex! It&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;re not mad! The truth is Kodi is a pretty powerful media player in its own right, and if you want infinite customizability and more switches and knobs than you can shake a stick at, Kodi may be the player for you. Today, we&#8217;re announcing a brand new way to have your cake and eat it too in the form of an official Plex add-on for Kodi.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been working closely with some of the best Kodi add-on developers in the world to create an awesome, fully-immersive Plex experience within Kodi. Seriously: once you&#8217;re up and running, you&#8217;ll never know it&#8217;s not Plex! You get the same Plex server discovery, user switching, gorgeous library browsing, and media playback experience you know and love, plus a few (okay, a few dozen) more settings to tweak to your heart&#8217;s content. <a href="https://www.plex.tv/apps/computer/kodi/">Check it all out here</a>!</p>
<p>The Plex for Kodi add-on is a Plex Pass only preview, and you can find it in the new <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/categories/plex-for-kodi" target="_blank">Plex for Kodi</a> forums <a href="http://forums.plex.tv/discussion/246911/installation-instructions#latest" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, suffice to say that even though we&#8217;ve been working hard on lots of great stuff to help you stream all over the place, the home theater is still just as important as ever, and we&#8217;ve got even more great stuff in store with Plex Media Player and our new Kodi add-on that we can&#8217;t wait to share soon&#8230;stay tuned!</p>

<strong>FAQ:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is the Kodi add-on feature-complete?</strong><br />
Most major features are already included in the add-on. A few exceptions are Plex Companion (remote control) support, channel support, and some music features. The add-on will become official any minute and will continue to be developed for the foreseeable future, and we&#8217;ll continue to evaluate additional features over time.</p>
<p><strong>Why doesn&#8217;t the Kodi add-on look like other Plex TV apps?</strong><br />
We are constantly working on evolving and improving our user interfaces across all our products, and we wanted to showcase some of our new thinking with this fresh new UI.</p>
<p><strong>Will the new TV user interface in the Kodi add-on come to Plex Media Player?</strong><br />
You might think so, right? We are definitely working to level up our TV interface, and you’ll see the fruits of our labors before too long. It’s been a bit of a long road, due to a bunch of internal re-architecturing we’ve been doing (fine print: moving to React is hard).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late last year, our team in Los Gatos moved into a new space, a former bank building. It is an amazing creative (and affordable!) workplace and we fit perfectly in there. There was one thing that bugged us, what to do with the awesome bank vault? It had 14 inch thick concrete walls and beautiful fluorescent lighting. We tried locking up all our valuables, but it turned out to be lot of wasted space. We instead decided to build an “everyman&#8217;s” home theater to showcase our Plex Media Server capabilities, and to watch a bunch of movies &#8211; I mean, we are cinephiles just like most of you!</p>
<p>Before, the vault was our &#8220;storage room&#8221;<br />

<p>To make sure we were getting the right gear at the right price, we had our friends at <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/" target="_blank">The Wirecutter</a>—one of our main go-to sites for gear recommendations—help pick out the <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/blog/a-high-end-home-theater-with-gear-most-people-can-afford" target="_blank">best pieces for our space</a>. Mat Lindstedt from <a href="http://svinstall.com/">Silicon Valley Installation Company</a>, pitched in as well. It was a fun project and we decided to share a little of our experience in building it, in hopes you all could benefit from our triumphs and tiny missteps. If you make it all the way to the bottom there is a great little video of our buildout experience.</p>

<p><strong>The first question&#8217;s for Scott. Scott, why did Plex even decide to do a theater in the first place?</strong></p>

<p>I think there were a handful of reasons. The first is, frankly, that a lot of our Plex users have very sophisticated home theater set ups. As a company, we didn&#8217;t actually have a setup where we could test things like Dolby Atmos or 7.1 surround sound or understand some of the needs of the different projectors or even some of the control stuff or home automation components that our users are really really interested in. It gave us an opportunity to get this higher-end gear into a place that we could do development and testing against. That was the first reason.</p>
<p>Second, we actually had a space in our office that we didn&#8217;t know what to do with. It was this old bank vault that had 14 inch thick rebar and concrete walls, floor, and ceiling&#8211;very, very secure and very, very useless for normal day-to-day business use. We thought it would be a great opportunity for us to put the space to use and create a showcase of our technology, as well.</p>

<p>I actually met Mike Berk (Executive Editor @Wirecutter) at CES this year and the idea had actually been forming in my head for a little while because we are huge fans of <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/" target="_blank">The Wirecutter</a> here at Plex&#8211;one of our main go-to sites for gear recommendations. In the back of my mind I was trying to figure out how to take these three different needs: one, setting up a place for us to QA and Dev against, two, to turn this space in our office into a showcase, and, three, figuring out what gear to use if we did that and possibly turn it into an opportunity for helping our users understand how a project like this could come together. That was the genesis of the idea. I asked Michael and the rest I think Chris knows.</p>

<p><strong>Cool. Chris, when people are thinking of putting together a home theater, what are some of the main budgetary considerations people have to think about? Then, as a follow up, what are some typical compromises that people have to make once they work through some of the budget stuff?</strong></p>

<p>People say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll buy this extra model because it has this extra feature that down the road I might wind up using.&#8221; Whereas most of the time you end up buying that and by the time you want to upgrade that feature and take advantage of it, something new is out or something else is there that you&#8217;re not going to wind up using.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think what people need to do first</span> is just understand the space they have. If you have a big, bright living room with lots of windows and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;re going to watch, you probably shouldn&#8217;t buy a projector. It&#8217;s not going to be a good idea for you. You&#8217;re going to have to buy a $4,000 screen to make that work and then that&#8217;s going to kill your budget.</p>
<p>I think once you realize what kind of space you have, and what you want to do, <span style="font-weight: 400">you can ask things like </span>does the picture matter more to you than the audio? Are you going to be doing lots of music listening? Are you going to have lots of people over or is it just you, because that might impact the TV you want for viewing angles or projectors or anything else.</p>

<p>Obviously, the space is pretty unique in that is was a cement vault and so we had some challenges there. I think that the space that we created really is the sweet spot for us. A couple of things, we&#8217;re agnostic about equipment. We don&#8217;t necessarily, have preferred brands that we like, but we&#8217;re pretty open about what works in the environment that we&#8217;re given. That was a pretty unique place.</p>
<p>Most places like that, or most homes, they don&#8217;t really have a space for a dedicated home theater. What they do is have space for a media room or a multi-purpose room where they may be watching movies and television programming and streaming things. The cool thing with the Plex folks is we got to come in and kind of design and work with Wirecutter on a space that is not only awesome for watching movies, but it&#8217;s also a great place to just kind of hang out there and watch some TV or stream stuff from laptops.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just going to jump in with one other comment that I probably should have mentioned earlier. One of our goals with this project was to find something that we thought was, from a budget perspective, in the vicinity of a somewhat normal human being. With that being said, we know it is clearly way out of many people&#8217;s budgets, but it&#8217;s certainly not on the fantastical side of the theater spectrum. I think that that was one of our goals: the project as more of “moderate” theater, not a &#8220;sky&#8217;s the limit approach&#8221;, which was a big part of what drove us. That&#8217;s one of the reasons why the fit with The Wirecutter was really solid.</p>

<p><strong>That&#8217;s a great point Scott. Quick question, even though Plex was creating this every man&#8217;s home theater based on our special situation, did you have any other special requirements for Plex?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, I think probably what I would say is the home automation components of what we&#8217;re trying to do here, integrating with the different remotes, integrating with Alexa and some of the other technologies that Mat and crew brought to the table was a big part of this. We really wanted to see where we are today with automation, where are we today with integration with these sort of things and it&#8217;s been really fun and exciting to see that stuff coming together as well.</p>

<p><strong>Hey Mat, you sort of touched on this about some of the challenges there were to building in a bank vault, can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the specifics and maybe see if there is a way that those relate to any other problems that other people might see in their homes.</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="large-2 medium-2 small-12 columns">
<p>Matt L.</p>

<div class="large-10 medium-10 small-12 columns">
<p>Yeah, I think one of the great things that we had with that room was it&#8217;s a nice bunker. It&#8217;s a relatively sound proof, light proof container in there which really is half the battle when you&#8217;re putting together a projector and a screen. Light control is big. Obviously there is no windows in there, so we had that. The challenges were obviously running cable as well as speakers and the projector back to the area that had the rack in it.</p>
<p>With a contractor he was able to build channels and we were able to find a local contractor here in the state that had the fabric materials for the walls so we were able to <span style="font-weight: 400">do a </span>relatively inexpensive cover up all our cabling with the track panels and it made for I think for a nice aesthetic look, but it also hid the cables and give us a good sound reinforcement as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about going back to what Scott said earlier, we were able, with Wirecutters help, to create a theater in that space for a budget that would have been two and three times as much for higher end components. I&#8217;m not sure at the end of the day you would have really noticed that big boost. I mean it sounds pretty amazing in there. That screen in there is fantastic, the projector is fantastic, and we really did like I said for components that are relatively inexpensive, we got a pretty amazing space.</p>

<p><strong>Chris, speaking about the space, was there any sort of gear selection difficulties that were created by that specific room?</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="large-2 medium-2 small-12 columns">
<p>Chris H.</p>
</div>
<div class="large-10 medium-10 small-12 columns">
<p>One of the main things that the room influenced, it didn&#8217;t influence the screen or the projector because that was easy since it was light controlled in there, the main challenges were with the speakers. We didn&#8217;t have a place to push them away from the walls or anything else, so they had to be up against the walls, mounted up on the walls out of the way so we could have more seating and that necessitated ones that didn&#8217;t have rear ports in them.</p>
<p>If you look at our gear selection we have the ELAC Debut Series as our speaker of choice typically, but in this case we went with the step up which is the KEF Q Series because it has front ports and it has keyhole jacks in the back so you can just easily wall mount that. Put it up on the wall, can be right up against it, doesn&#8217;t impact its quality, it does great.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier by Mat, we can take your room even and for someone who has a smaller budget easily scale that down a little bit by going to say like the $800 BenQ Projector and getting rid of the Atmos since a lot of people aren&#8217;t going to do in ceiling speakers and scale that down a lot and people are still going to get 80% to 90% of that. They can&#8217;t do 4K and they can&#8217;t do Atmos, but for people who are streaming and don&#8217;t have that, they can still save even more and get a huge impact theater for a really good price, put that into any space that they want.</p>

<p>Probably the most surprising thing to me is how much I love the room. I&#8217;ll be honest&#8211;I really thought this could be a half baked project, that the bank vault and the budget we were working with had the potential to be a total disaster with a disappointing outcome and ultimately a failed experiment might be the way I would put it. I&#8217;ll tell you right now, it&#8217;s my favorite place to watch a movie. It really is! I&#8217;m not just saying that because of the parties involved or because I have to, but because of the quality of the end result. The room, the sound, the screen, the projector, the automation, and the simplicity of the whole thing is awesome.</p>
<p>I really, really thought that we were going to hit some bump in the road that was going to make this a real bummer and it&#8217;s been almost the opposite. Kudos to everyone that did the work and actually made this happen. I think it&#8217;s a real statement on the state of technology today&#8211;that you can really, really make an amazing room and provide an amazing experience on this level of budget. I would have imagined that this would have cost an order of magnitude more to achieve, to give me that level of experience where I&#8217;m like, “yep, this is the best place to watch a movie now”. I don&#8217;t choose to go to a commercial theater over going to our theater. That&#8217;s a big deal.</p>

<p>Yeah, and you know to be honest with you, we lucked out on that. I mean normally how we would do chairs and the wall coverings are we would work with a local designer, they would show us a thousand different patterns and colors. We&#8217;d work with these fabric guys that would stitch in the fabric into the acoustical panels, obviously we didn&#8217;t want to do that. I mean I literally found a company in Los Angeles on the web, searching. Actually for the chairs, now the chairs we would normally contract those out to companies that started $1,500 to $3,000 per electric chair.</p>
<p>We just happen to find a company in Los Angeles for I think those chairs were $500 bucks each. They happen to have fabric selections as well for the acoustical panels. We kind of took a risk on that and we just said let&#8217;s just do it, let&#8217;s try it. We just got lucky on those chairs and I think they&#8217;re amazing. I think they&#8217;re comfortable, they look good, they&#8217;re motorized for less than $500 bucks, which is impossible.</p>

<p>Yeah, the other thing I&#8217;d mention at this point is that the sound is really, really incredible in there. There&#8217;s two pieces that we need to probably understand better and would love to figure out as we go forward. That is to understand how to better calibrate the sound and picture. I even bought one of those $250 Datacolor Spyder color calibration devices for dialing in the projector, even though the experience is pretty incredible already. The geek inside me wonders if could it be even better? Could we dial this in even more? Who knows?</p>

<p><strong>As far as just the last question on the build out and the gear stuff and Chris, this is in your wheelhouse, what are some lessons that we learned from our build and other lessons that you&#8217;ve seen other people learn?</strong></p>

<p>Chris H.</p>
</div>
<div class="large-10 medium-10 small-12 columns">
<p>I almost always wind up telling people never to buy the best gear, because the best gear usually entails this huge price premium over something that&#8217;s good enough. If you look at two and a half years ago that&#8217;s when you saw our first OLED TV. That was a 50 or 55 inch curved screen and that was $12,000. It&#8217;s been two and a half years, you get a flat 55 inch, ultra HD, high dynamic range, white color gamut, and it&#8217;s $2,500. Usually if you sit there and say, &#8220;Well I can get a good enough TV now or a good enough usually it&#8217;s TV&#8217;s or projectors, speakers are pretty much static, they usually don&#8217;t adjust nearly as much.”</p>
<p>We try to find <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-gear-for-your-home-theater/" target="_blank">what&#8217;s the best for most people</a> which is usually going to be something cheaper and might not have some cutting edge feature, but like as we saw with 4K, 4K when it came out was very expensive and now 4K TV&#8217;s are really cheap and early ones didn&#8217;t even have high dynamic range or white color gamut or HDMI 2.0a, so they are kind of left behind because they were just too cutting edge at that point and people were paying too much money for them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll say the same thing that we actually tell home owners who are coming in to build their dream media room. If you look at the list of components that we have in the theater for Plex, there&#8217;s not really one thing that&#8217;s super expensive. I mean they&#8217;re all really consumer electronics that you could go into Best Buy or Amazon and buy and it just adds up. Like anything else, they add up quickly. The components themselves on a piece by piece basis are very reasonable.</p>

<p><strong>Mat, all the equipment&#8217;s installed, all the electrical, that all has power, everything&#8217;s working, what&#8217;s that dialing in process look like? What&#8217;s important, what&#8217;s the most challenging thing?</strong></p>

<p>What was cool about this theater was that we were on a pretty tight schedule and candidly we didn&#8217;t have a big budget to do a whole lot. I mean we really had to get in there, install the things, and get out. The cool thing about it was is that we were able to run the cable, hang the speakers, hang the projector, and everything just kind of worked out out of the box. We&#8217;ve been doing this for a long time and the great thing with modern technology like the Atmos receiver and the JVC 4K projector is they really do work 95% out of the box ready to go.</p>
<p>I can install calibrators in there, we can talk about doing compression audio and really dial it in, but for my clients and Chris, you can probably adhere to this, you set up the sound and the first thing the client does is he stands in the back of the room and says, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I hear the speakers in the rear?&#8221; You explain to them well they&#8217;re designed to come on depending on the content you&#8217;re watching, listening to and they don&#8217;t care about that. They want to hear the speakers. They want to hear the speakers for other things.</p>
<p>My point is that system in there sounds amazing and looks amazing, we could probably continue to tweak it and we will tweak it, but the awesome thing with the budget system is you don&#8217;t have to bring in hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars of calibration equipment in there to notch it up that extra 5%. Wouldn&#8217;t you say that Chris?</p>

<p>Yeah, I mean I&#8217;m an <a href="https://www.imagingscience.com/dealers.php?search=United%20States:%20Oregon" target="_blank">ISF certified calibrator</a>, so I go in and tune in your TV or do your projector. Most people don&#8217;t need that. Most people will be very happy with their <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/leaderboard/tvs/" target="_blank">TV</a> or <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/leaderboard/projectors/" target="_blank">projector</a> if they use the mode that&#8217;s the accurate pre-set movie mode or cinema. Like the JVC has cinema mode and then you can choose the type of screen you have that&#8217;s supported in there, it will adjust the color based off your type of screen a little bit. That&#8217;s going to be 99% of the way there and save you $300 to $500 for a setup fee.</p>
<p>You sit there and do the basic set ups and read a couple of guides that where you should position speakers or how you should set the brightness and contrast on a TV or projector, that&#8217;s going to get you 90%, 95% of the way there and it&#8217;s not going to cost you a thing. If you want to go the full distance you can and you can spend hundreds of dollars to bring in a professional to do calibration, but for most people it&#8217;s not going to be worth it. You could have spent that money to go get better gear and get a better experience, unless you&#8217;re building a $100,000 home theater.</p>

<p>Often when we bring in that professional to &#8220;calibrate the projector,&#8221; it&#8217;s often you know people like bright. They want high contrast, so we dial it in to this &#8220;reference video quality&#8221; and then the person or client says a week later, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s kind of dark. Can we set it back to the way it was?&#8221; Then we&#8217;re back to ground zero.</p>

<p>From a control perspective, obviously we wanted to have the traditional remote control capability where people familiar with that, could walk in and do that and gets to some of the more advanced features. We wanted something that we could control the entire system from the receiver and projector to the lights, and the actual media interface Plex or whatever client we choose. We installed a number of different ones including Roku and Nvidia Shield, and Apple TV as well as a NUC running our Plex Media Player on there.</p>
<p>We wanted to have that, but we also wanted to be able to control as much of this as possible from Alexa from the Amazon Echo. The hope was to find a way to make all these pieces you know you just walk in and ask the system to turn on, lights come up or lights come down, and everything just kind of works. I think we achieved that.</p>

<p>Yeah. I think that most of the stuff I&#8217;m interested in right now probably comes down more to Plex. We want to get some further automation integration, when you pause it, maybe the lights come up a little bit. Things that are more tied into the Plex experience, so those things are on the road map, we don&#8217;t have dates, but when I start playing a movie maybe the screen is different than a TV show. Or when I play a funny thing on YouTube, the lights wouldn&#8217;t have to be down completely.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some interesting things that we&#8217;re interested in trying to do to kind of tie the entire experience together. Those are things that are going to require a little bit more plotting and planning and thinking, but there&#8217;s no question now that I&#8217;ve really seen the beginning of what&#8217;s possible I want to keep that story and finish that experience.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re actually in semi-partnership with, we&#8217;ve been doing it for a couple years now, a company called Simple Control, formally Roomie Remote. They&#8217;re a local company here in the valley and they created an amazing app for IOS devices currently. They want to port to Android a<a href="https://www.simplecontrol.com/" target="_blank"></a>nd others, but right now it&#8217;s IOS. It&#8217;s basically an iPhone and iPad app that allow you to control probably about 50% of all components that have IP controllable that you can control.</p>
<p>In this particular Plex theater every single device has an IP control. You can pull the app up and we can say okay, turn on the home theater, watch Plex, watch Apple TV and we don&#8217;t have the IR blinkies anymore, that used to plague us for years and years. It&#8217;s very reliable, it&#8217;s very fast, and it allows for two way communication. When you go to Apple TV or even the Plex server, you can see very rich two way content from your iPad of what you&#8217;re actually seeing up on the screen. You can&#8217;t do that with a static remote control that is a one-way communication.</p>

<p>I think you guys have a fairly advanced theater as far as most people go, but most people aren&#8217;t running Atmos or anything like that yet because they don&#8217;t want to drill speakers in the ceiling.</p>
<p>I think lots of people <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/blog/a-high-end-home-theater-with-gear-most-people-can-afford" target="_blank">run into these challenges setting the home theater up</a>. How do I run wires, speakers somewhere, how do I hide all this stuff without making huge modifications. If you&#8217;re someone who can do wire channels pretty easy without doing much damage to the wall with a couple of nails or some 3M sticky stuff or whatever they need to do to keep it up there, I mean I think everyone can learn from this. Maybe figuring out, well I really like this gear, but maybe it doesn&#8217;t work for my room because I can&#8217;t run a projector. Or these speakers have to go against the walls.</p>
<p>When people come home and can just put on the football game from last night for example, or play my Pandora station and it will just work. That&#8217;s going to make lots of people consider doing these kinds of systems more because it&#8217;s just going to be easy for them to set up and use. I think if we get that integration in the next year or two that more people are going to consider doing this type of system because it&#8217;s going to fit better into their lifestyle.</p>
