					<description><![CDATA[Nice idea in principle, but this is actually making finding photos worse for me than no tags at all. Simply searching for &quot;soccer&quot; yields extraneous photos of kids playing baseball, pictures in the backyard, or even just a picture of my garden. And none of my high-quality telephotos of soccer action were tagged with soccer at all. I have the EXIF tags already there, if they could simply read the EXIF and import those as searchable terms I&#039;d be happy! And while your at it, import the geotagging info too!]]></description>

...Like me.  I hate manual tagging: I tried it and it sucks.  However, It would be a godsend if you could facetag people and the AI figure out all photos of that person ordered by year+month.  My childs 8th birthday party?  No problem!  Geotagging so I can search by country?  &quot;Wifey, when was it we want to Turkey again&quot;?  See that&#039;s what&#039;s missing from photo libraries still.  No-one has time to tag and sort 40k digital images manually _after the fact_.]]></description>

and that&#039;s just the sort of thing that makes it difficult to trust anyone in business (omission and need to know) - because Swisscom may be using you but doesn&#039;t actually send you anything does it -quote from the link you provided &quot;There were two major requirements - state of the art technology and 
ability to install it on Swisscom premises, for privacy and security 
reasons that are very important for their cloud product&quot; so what they are actually doing is using you&#039;re technology in house (because, unlike plex, they don&#039;t trust you enough to let you do it on you&#039;re own premises) -today it identifies that it&#039;s a person in a picture with other people, tomorrow it identifies the people by name and where the picture was taken and it puts this data together with the known income, bank details, spending habits, every &quot;security question&quot; they ever answered (pets name, mothers maiden name etc) when they are at home from there smart meter, what they ate from there smart fridge (and any accompanying fines for eating unhealthily or to deny healthcare ) where they travel to from there gps smartphone, who is on there contact list, every website they ever visited, every email, txt , tv programmed viewed and phone conversation they ever had. It&#039;s a blackmailers paradise that just happens to work nicely to sell you stuff to -or make you get back into line should you ever step out. BUT YOUR PICTURES are safe - we don&#039;t need to keep a copy, just a copy of the tags we identified when our technology gets good enough to be useful.  
there is only one way to protect yourself, your friends  and your children -and that&#039;s to keep it to yourself! do we think this comment is going to stay? -well lets see.....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried this over my photo library of about 40,000 images. It spent days creating thumbnails and stuff and meanwhile I went on holiday. After the server settled down I looked at I couldn&#039;t see anything had happened. I turned it back off for now.

There&#039;s a lot of work needed here and it appears in the devs keeness to e leading edge they&#039;ve forgotten the basics - such as a tag editor, a control facility, logging etc.]]></description>

It is just automatically added scene/subject based tags. like &quot;landscape&quot; or &quot;dogs&quot;  There is no editing of those tags yet]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am trying to understand this feature.  I have many family photos that I want to share with my extended family.  Easy enough.  Now I want them to be able to edit the comments and add face tags to document who it in the photos.  I can&#039;t seem to figure out how to edit or do anything except view from any app.  How does this work?]]></description>
