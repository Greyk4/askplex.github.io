					<description><![CDATA[i think that plex pass cost should be allowed at a lower price like for sale prices  more often cause there are a lot of people including myself who would like that license at a discount, just think of how many times playon has discounts for their playon plus license
its pretty amazing how they manage to have the price keep bouncing up and down
 
i&#039;d love to see what you guys come up with involving more features : )
generally because so it can help to grow the features for plex so it starts to be more like the Netflix&#039;s or the hulu&#039;s or the amazon&#039;s or comcast&#039;s of the streaming world, but with enough understanding that its well organized, and that theres enough software and hardware intergration from lots of devices to back it up
i enjoy plex and am very happy : )
and i am very happy as both as a netflix viewer 
and as a comcast viewer as well ,too

overall, i think plex is doing a good job
and hope that they will add more features
as well as allow for discounts to the plex pass soon]]></description>

@Clara  there are no plans that I am aware of to offer a sale on Plex Pass subscriptions. There&#039;s always a possibility we may offer one in the future but it is highly unlikely we will announce that ahead of time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I trailed this for a couple of weeks, using a seagate personal cloud combined with Roku and an Android tablet. Was very impressed at the metadata retrieval for my archived movies, which improved the experience when deciding what to watch between Netflix, NowTV, Live TV and my recorded films. Was disappointed that I was unable to use it on my XBOX one with paying for a plex pass. It is better than the seagate application that is always free (and faster at loading films to play). However I have taken the plunge for a lifetime membership because of the ability to sync to my portable device when I&#039;m commuting to work. I just hope you don&#039;t stiff me later by moving this functionality to a premium service that requires an additional surcharge. I would drop Plex at that point even if it was still the best software for the job, out of principle.
I have been a software developer for over 30yrs (mainframe) and am always judgemental of user experience not being properly considered or tested, but I have to commend your developers - Plex works well, and is very intuitive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[YIKES!  A lot of haters out there!  If you don&#039;t like it, DONT USE IT!!    

PLEX has been worth every penny to me.    Its an amazing solution to stream to everything in my house, it&#039;s well organized, and offers lots of features.  They even make the server app for lots of NAS devices which really helps make this a viable long term solution with little complication.

Thanks Plex!  Keep up the good work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a long-time Netflix customer, I&#039;d be _very_ happy if you had a for-fee streaming service. Hulu is ridiculous, Netflix &quot;just works&quot;, but I&#039;d love to see what you guys could come up with. Maybe a trial service?

Netflix has DVD mailings and streaming, but streaming is so limited, it&#039;s a joke. If you guys just focused on streaming... :)

Oh, and you might consider something like a very-low-cost &quot;scheduled low-band downloads&quot; for offline viewing; even if it&#039;s DRM-protected with an expiration timebomb, it&#039;d make a nice alternative for when someone wants a 1-time viewing of something. Maybe have a sort of server-based (ours, not yours) &quot;vault&quot; where low-band downloads could be kept and would expire after a while, maybe with scaled pricing for various expiration periods.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Damn Damn Damn.... Can&#039;t believe I found out JUST NOW about the price increase! I had just canceled my long term monthly subscription because a stint of funds being tight, but if I&#039;d know I would have bought that lifetime option immediately.  Yearly it is :_(  with my PLEX Shirt and all...

					<description><![CDATA[To all of you Quakers and Amish folks out there that do not have a credit card.  Go to the store and buy a Visa Gift card for $150. 

Use the gift card to pay for your subscription.

Then while you are enjoying your Plex Pass... you can watch folks on T.V. who bathe on a regular basis.

Thank You]]></description>
