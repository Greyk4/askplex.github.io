					<description><![CDATA[@andy: It uses ffmpeg for decoding, albeit an unoptimized version for now, so the CPU usage should be similar to other players that also use ffmpeg. However, as a real world example, I&#039;ve found skipping through MKV files to be quite a bit faster than with other players I&#039;ve tried. The XBMC core code is well written!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@elan -

I submitted the stack trace to your bug tracker.  Hopefully this is where you want it, as I couldn&#039;t find an email address anywhere.

Thanks so much to your whole team for this!  I have been hoping to get rid of my XBOX for ages!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@yaneku: Make sure you go to Audio Hardware settings and set the Audio Output to Digital and enable AC3/DTS Capable Receiver. The log looks right. That&#039;s all I can say for now, sadly. It works flawlessly on my Marantz SR-7000.

@Qwan: Apple remote will act like cursor keys, so it will do something, but XBMC really needs a more fully keyed remote. You can tweak KeyMap.xml to help out. I&#039;m thinking of using a bluetooth Apple keyboard, and perhaps getting a wireless Xbox360 controller working.

@Matt: One individual was kind enough to donate some great beer to the cause.

@Jasper: Subs are known broken.

@everyone: Thanks so much for your kind words!

If you&#039;re getting a crash (playing videos, for example), a stack trace helps me greatly. Do the following to obtain one:

$ gdb XBMC
&#062; run
.... crash ...
&#062; where
... send me this output ...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok. Now I&#039;ve tried the digital output using a minijack-toslink cable. All I get is noise i my speakers. My reciever doesn&#039;t realize that it should decode the dts signal and tries to play it as a regular signal (probably?). The same movies with dts/ac3 works in VLC when enabling S/PDIF. Regular movies/music in xbmc works fine.

When I try to play a dts or ac3 movie I get this debug text:

Asked to open device: [iec958]
Asked to create device:   [iec958]
Device should be digital: [1]]]></description>
