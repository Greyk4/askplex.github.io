					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m disappointed how Plex treats Android platform as an afterthought. The Android app, in terms of usability, is a mess. Its missing key functionality in the video player and is littered with bugs. For example, you can&#039;t skip the video by 5s or 15s. There is still no support for scrapping Rotten Tomato ratings on Android and simple information like actors, movie directors etc isn&#039;t displayed. I almost never use the Web app which Plex team has put a lot of work in however Android app which I and many others use on a daily basis is being ignored. I love Plex but can you please focus on fixing issues in the Android app.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also glad elan got a Shield. The hardware is fantastic. It just needs some Plex software love.
As mentioned auto refresh rate is borked, and ff/rw isn&#039;t user friendly (but I hear Google expects all leanback apps to all behave the same)
Also not having a pause button on the remote was a huge mistake...but netflix treats the enter button like pause. Plex should do the same. It sucks to have to double press to pause, as there is a 1-2 second lag.
Plex doesn&#039;t crash on the Shield too much these days, but it still happens too often.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome job guys. Ps3 app is much smoother and responsive. Ps4 is rock solid as always. Android streaming is even faster and above all, you guys are listenning to your clients and fixing/updating /adding what the community is asking for.

Keep up the great work. :)
