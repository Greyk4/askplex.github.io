										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Who‚Äôs Down With OP‚Ä¶ ML?</h3>
<p>It was just two short months ago that we first announced Podcasts in Plex and we‚Äôre back to officially take it out of beta and announce a few highly-requested additions!</p>
<p><strong>Offline support:</strong> No connectivity in your beach caba√±a/ski chalet? No problem. It‚Äôs a piece of keto-cake to configure your favorite podcasts for offline listening. You can download single episodes with a single tap or set up a smart rule to make sure you have enough Joe Rogan to make it through that long flight to some country without an extradition treaty. We‚Äôre not judging.</p>

<p><strong>Come to the Plex Side:</strong> It‚Äôs now super easy to migrate your existing list of podcasts over to Plex, using our OPML (it‚Äôs pronounced ‚Äúop-mul‚Äù) import feature (available on iOS, Android, or the web). There‚Äôs a pretty good chance your ex-favorite podcast app lets you export your feeds in this format, and you can now import them all into Plex in a single bound. Give it a shot!</p>

<p><strong>Everywhere you are:</strong> Well, maybe not everywhere, but you can now enjoy podcasts on those sweet-sounding Sonos speakers!  And in the car‚Äîsafely‚Äîwith Android Auto! And you can now easily cast them to any Chromecast enabled device!</p>
<p>We hope you continue to enjoy having access to all this great content inside Plex as much as we are! And in dog news, Barkley is considering starting his own Podcast called ‚ÄúThings The Humans Put on Me For Their Amusement‚Äù</p>
<p><em>Sorry Barkley, &#8216;The Joe Rogan Experience&#8217; is not suitable for children or dogs!</em><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re a blog-reading Plex user (and we have a feeling you are <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="üëã" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), there&#8217;s a pretty good chance you care a lot about personalizing your media collection. Maybe you&#8217;ve searched tirelessly for <a href="http://hiconsumption.com/2012/11/star-wars-trilogy-minimalist-posters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">minimalist hipster posters</a> for each of your Star Wars movies or painstakingly created music playlists for each of your many moods. Plex has always given you the ability to customize your library, but today we&#8217;re rolling out an update for iOS and Android that gives you even more control over your overall experience.</p>
<p>The philosophy behind this redesign focuses on a reimagining of the way the Plex apps are structured. It elevates some important decisions (‚Äúwhat do I want to watch or listen to?‚Äù) and deemphasizes some less important ones (‚Äúwhere is it coming from?‚Äù). There are three core aspects to the redesign:</p>
<p><strong>Customizable Home Screen:</strong> You <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-the-apps/">now have complete control</a> over the home screen of the app: you can reorder (or remove) any of the sections (like ‚ÄúRecently Added‚Äù or ‚ÄúOn Deck‚Äù) or add new ones from anywhere else in the app, even across different servers (mix and match!).</p>

<p><strong>Easier Top-level Navigation:</strong> We‚Äôve added tabs at the bottom of the screen to <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/navigating-the-apps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quickly navigate between</a> media types (Movies, TV, etc.), and those are fully customizable as well. Do you always watch movies on your tablet and listen to music on your phone? Arrange the tabs accordingly. Don&#8217;t care at all about photos in Plex? First of all, you&#8217;re a monster, but hey, now you can turn &#8217;em off and focus on the media you prefer.</p>

<p>So, you‚Äôve been curating your own little Marvel Cinematic Universe and decking your Breaking Bad collection with care. You‚Äôve got the soundtracks, the artwork, and the extras to match. You know what you need? 150 hours of Vince Gilligan creator-splaining Walter White‚Äôs motivation. This is where podcasts really shine. No rules, just words.</p>
<p>Here at Plex we like to use every part of the media and hate it when good content goes to waste. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre adding support for the incredibly rich and diverse body of content that is Podcasts. We love the scrappy, two-people-and-a-mic nature of this ecosystem. It‚Äôs egalitarian, fanatical, and sometimes just a little bit rough-around-the-edges, but we think it‚Äôs a perfect complement to the rest of your Plex diet.</p>
<p>Podcasts are also a great fit for the media platform we‚Äôve built here at Plex, which is probably why people have asked us to add them for years. Features like On Deck, synced view state, rich metadata, and our incredibly diverse range of platforms means that you can enjoy podcasts like never before.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre excited to be launching Podcasts in beta inside Plex today on iOS, Android, Roku, and Plex Web, (more to come, of course!) and we‚Äôd like to highlight a <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/podcasts-overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">few of the features available</a>. Best of all, podcasts are free for all users and don&#8217;t even require a Plex Media Server to be set up.</p>
<p><strong>Rich Search and Discovery:</strong> It‚Äôs easy to search for a specific podcast if you know what you‚Äôre looking for, or browse by genre, or see what‚Äôs popular. Once you start listening and building your library, our machine learning team has built a sophisticated system which delivers personalized recommendations for new podcasts.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Podcasts:</strong> Once you‚Äôve found podcasts you enjoy (and we‚Äôre sure you will!) you can add them to ‚ÄòMy Podcasts‚Äô and your home screen. Once there, they‚Äôll act much like a show in your personal TV libraries, with features like On Deck to make podcast bingeing just as easy as that little addiction to Ice Road Truckers you have, Ben.</p>

<p><strong>Enhanced Player:</strong> In order to give you the best possible listening experience, we‚Äôve upgraded the players inside our mobile apps and the web app to allow for variable speed playback, as well as quickly skipping backwards or forwards.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs especially nice to use podcasts inside Plex with our newly customizable home screen. In the car, clearly you should be keeping your eyes on the road, so you can build a home screen with Recently Added music, On Deck for podcasts, and whatever other audio content you feel like!</p>

<p>We‚Äôre launching in beta so you can start playing (literally!) with Podcasts inside Plex, but we have more great features coming soon, including OPML importing, and offline podcast support for our mobile apps. You can find out more about Podcasts in Plex on our support site.</p>
<p><em>Podcasts are rolling out slowly to all supported platforms. Should be available by midday EDT to everyone.</em></p>
<p>You would think Barkley‚Äôs favorite podcast would be canine-oriented, but he actually loves listening to the mellifluous tones of <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Terry Gross</a>. It lulls him to sleep within minutes&#8230;</p>

It‚Äôs the perfect complement to your media library ‚Äî video news from some of the most trusted sources on the planet, presented beautifully and seamlessly alongside your own media.

There‚Äôs so much amazing media available today that you‚Äôd be forgiven for taking in an entire season of Game of Thrones or the whole Marvel cinematic universe (once you figure out the order) without coming up for air. But it turns out some pretty crazy stuff is happening every day in the<em> real</em> universe, too, and we think it‚Äôs more important than ever to provide balanced news coverage from a variety of trusted and reliable sources.¬†If Plex were a nutritious media breakfast, it‚Äôs kind of like eating your Wheaties. But with less carbs. Those things will kill you.</p>
<p>Starting with our recent <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/we-have-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition of Watchup</a>, we‚Äôve worked hard to partner with the most reputable and trustworthy news sources around the world to bring you coverage from a wide variety of viewpoints. We have over 190 global publisher partners (and growing!), including international sources, like CNN, CBS, Financial Times, and Euronews, and local news sources for over 80% of markets in the US. We also have regional content for many other countries and we‚Äôre continually adding new sources. So whether you‚Äôre a #woke hipster or an <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old man yelling at a cloud</a>, we‚Äôve got something for you.<br />

Plex News is especially exciting to us because it follows a progression we started with Live TV and DVR where we‚Äôre bringing you great media from outside your library in a way which integrates seamlessly and beautifully. This makes it easier than ever to start using Plex if you‚Äôre new, and gives you another universe of content to explore outside of your own media, without ever leaving Plex.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you all know, media is our lifeblood. For the better part of a decade, we&#8217;ve been working obsessively and tirelessly to craft the best media platform on the planet (before it&#8217;s destroyed in a tweet gone wrong). This is why it gives us¬†great pleasure to announce that we&#8217;ve acquired the streaming news service Watchup.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-800x488.jpg" alt="Plex acquires Watchup" class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-6065 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-800x488.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-768x468.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-1024x624.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-1800x1098.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-1440x878.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-640x390.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-400x244.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/plex-watchup-150x91.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>If the last year has taught us anything, it&#8217;s that news is a very important part of our media diet. Especially as a cord-cutter, as many of you are, it can be challenging to find that nourishment, like when you hide kale from a hipster.</p>
<p>A few months ago, we introduced the awesome new <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/dvr/">Plex DVR</a>, which gives people an incredibly simple way to suck content out of thin air (or cable) and store it in their libraries. We were able to leverage many aspects of our platform in order to provide you with features and ease of use not found elsewhere. <span style="font-weight: 400">This kind of awesome, unified experience just isn&#8217;t possible for others, and we&#8217;re going to be building on that as we move forward to bring news media to you in a holistic manner within Plex!</span></p>
<p>Why Watchup? Well, they have a super talented engineering group who has built a remarkable system with advanced machine learning which processes local, national, and international news to generate a feed personalized just for you. Just as importantly, they have partnered with over 150 publishers, including a number who have invested in the company.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to welcome all of the employees of Watchup (another fully remote company!) to our merry band of Plex makers. They are a wonderful group of people who are just as passionate about news as we are about media (and kale). Barkley can&#8217;t wait to meet them all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks everyone, for the great response to our first episode of the Plex Podcast released along with the new Plex Web Client; that gave us the (foolish) idea to do another episode!</p>
<p>In this episode, Tobias is joined by Plex Ninjas <a href="http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php/user/3660-ziggimon/">Mark &#8220;Ziggimon&#8221; Walker</a> and <a href="http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php/user/7970-trudge/">Paul &#8220;Trudge&#8221; Trudgian</a> to discuss what hardware you might want to get for that ultimate Plex setup. It&#8217;s quite a long discussion about different setups and all the different factors that you need to consider (a LOT of them). A special thanks to <a href="http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php/user/24709-pooploser/">Milos Radosavac</a> for editing this episode.</p>
<p>You can subscribe to the Plex Podcast in <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/se/podcast/plex-podcast/id557525559?l=en">iTunes</a>, or <a href="http://plexapp.com/podcasts/podcast.xml">directly</a>. You can also get a direct link to episode #2 <a href="http://plexapp.com/podcasts/Plex%20Podcast%20%232.m4a">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mike Meier, we also have a Plex Podcast channel available in the channel directory if you want to listen to the podcast via Plex.</p>
<p>Enjoy, and please let us know in the comments what sort of topics you&#8217;d like to see in the future!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s some new stuff for you to enjoy in the Plex App Store today. First of all, we have a plug-in for the popular Daily Kos site. If progressive politics if your thing, you&#8217;ll likely enjoy this one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;padding:10px"><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/untitled11.png" alt="untitled.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">If you prefer to get your politics directly from the White House, Chris Tarczon (author of the popular IGN plug-in) wrote a plug-in which gives you access to Obama&#8217;s weekly addresses (in HD!) and other White House content.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;padding:10px">
<img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/untitled12.png" alt="untitled.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">And for those of you who don&#8217;t care a whit about (American) politics, but like your rock indie flavored, install the Pitchfork TV plug-in, which provides access to a *ton* of content, including band interviews, live performances, music videos, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;padding:10px"><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/untitled10.png" alt="untitled.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We&#8217;ve also released an update to the CNET plug-in so that the &#8220;Today on CNET&#8221; section actually reflects the current date.</p>
