										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We first launched support for Live TV and DVR with the stated goal of creating the best DVR on the planet: A totally seamless experience, perfectly paired with your Plex Media Server. Just add a tuner and antenna and you’re all set: Free broadcast HD shows and movies anywhere, any time, on virtually any device.</p>
<h3>Growing Pains: turns out it’s more than just a seminal 80s comedy with a surprisingly nuanced performance by Kirk Cameron</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/plex-blog-livetv-player-pip-updated.gif" /></p>
<p style="font-size: 1em; font-style: italic; margin-top: -30px !important; text-align: center; color: #868C96;">Navigate effortlessly between program guide, info, and recording in our new Apple TV UI.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years and we think we&#8217;re continuing to make good on that promise, but it is fair to say we&#8217;ve had a few challenges along the way. We&#8217;ve had our share of bugs: players would get cranky and refuse to &#8220;play from beginning&#8221;, or some live TV format in some specific region would make the Server trip over its own shoelaces. We also had to switch our source for program guide data early last year, which brought a few growing pains and regional differences. Throughout all of this, a loyal army of Plexians came together to help us identify these issues and work out the kinks. It would be impossible for us to test every device, format, and piece of program guide data on our own, and we&#8217;d like to extend a heartfelt Plex hug (or socially distant equivalent) for your help and patience.</p>
<h3>Right, so&#8230; let’s see the new newness</h3>
<p>We&#8217;d like to highlight some awesome improvements and some brand new features we&#8217;ve been working on in the past few months.</p>
<p>First, a few quality-of-life improvements: The time it takes to tune new channels should be greatly reduced, from twelve or more seconds in some cases down to just a few now. We&#8217;ve made lots of fixes around &#8220;watch from start,” seeking while watching live, and resuming in-progress recordings. We&#8217;ve improved the genre-specific recommendations, and added quick access to recently-watched channels.</p>
<p>We have also added several new featured rows, gathering similar kinds of programming together so you can see what movies are coming on later or what your kids can watch (once they’ve finished with school, of course). These are available on Android, Apple, Roku, and our web app.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen-800x450.png" alt="" class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-15989 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen-800x450.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen-300x169.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen-768x432.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen-1800x1013.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen-1440x810.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen-640x360.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen-400x225.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen-150x84.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/plex-blog-movies-on-later-screen.png 1920w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="font-size: 1em; font-style: italic; margin-top: -30px !important; text-align: center; color: #868C96;">Check out new featured rows that showcase what’s on later, whether it’s movies for you or shows for the kids. Superwings to the rescue!</p>
<h3>We put your thumb on blast</h3>
<p>Live TV now uses our new improved interface for some of our most popular platforms (with support for even more platforms coming in the future), which includes some specific improvements: the ability to kick off a recording directly from the player, and quick access to recent channels. Now you can fly around from show to show with blazing speed. Available on Android TV and Apple TV, coming soon to our other platforms.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; font-style: italic; margin-top: -30px !important; text-align: center; color: #868C96;">Start recording a show or turn on those closed captions: with new controls on your play screen you can do more without missing a moment.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; font-style: italic; margin-top: -30px !important; text-align: center; color: #868C96;">Press record while watching to automatically add the series to your DVR.</p>
<h3>Channel previews so your eyes don’t get lonely</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve also made major improvements to the program guide. It&#8217;s prettier, way faster when scrolling around, and now includes a pretty cool picture-in-guide view of your currently tuned channel so you won&#8217;t miss a beat! Picture-in-guide is available on Android TV and Apple TV.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; font-style: italic; margin-top: -30px !important; text-align: center; color: #868C96;">With our picture-in-guide feature (PiG! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f437.png" alt="🐷" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), you’ll never lose sight of what you&#8217;re watching, even when you’re peaking at that channel guide or setting a new recording!</p>
<h3>Coming soon: we cast where others fear to tread</h3>
<p>To pile onto the updates, our long-awaited Chromecast integration is out for iOS and is shipping for Android in the next few weeks. This has been a highly requested feature, and we’re excited to be able to continue to deliver on the promise of ease of access and interoperability across the rival factions of devices, operating systems and at-times-needy home speakers. At Plex, we think of ourselves as the Switzerland of Streaming. In that we’re a neutral player in the platform wars, we love the pursuit of engineering perfection, and we have a thing for giant sloppy dogs that like to carry tiny <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ANDZYAx7tQ">Malört</a> kegs around their necks.</p>

<h3>That Live TV tho</h3>
<p>So maybe you&#8217;ve got a tuner and antenna collecting dust somewhere, or maybe you need to pick one up (here’s a list of our officially-supported <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/225877427-supported-dvr-tuners-and-antennas/">tuners and antennas</a>), and just <em>maybe</em> you&#8217;re stuck at home with a little spare time on your hands right now (and itching to buy some <a href="https://www.plex.tv/ad/community-love-plex-fam/">new hardware from our partners</a>). Now with our newly shipped updates, you’ll discover that  Live TV and DVR in Plex has never worked better. As we announced last week, for the next few months <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/live-tv-over-the-air-functionality-free-through-june-30-2020/561368">we’re making Live TV completely free</a> through the end of June, with no Plex Pass required. There&#8217;s never been a better time to give it a shot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Um. Suffice it to say that a lot has happened since we last blogged a few months back. This may not be your typical Plex blog post, but it’ll probably be one of the least crazy things to happen today. </p>
<p>Quite a few of you have reached out to share how much Plex has helped over the past weeks and how it fits in to your shelter-in-place regimen, whether it’s keeping kids from tearing each other’s hair out, or keeping family and friends fed with a steady stream of media to pass the time. To be clear, we’re on the far fringes of being able to make a meaningful contribution to returning things to normal. While we’re not working on the cure*, we’re incredibly honored to know that we’re working on something that may make the mitigation a little more tolerable for all of you. It gives us a renewed sense of purpose. We won’t let you down.</p>
<h3>28 <del>Days</del> <del>Hours</del> Minutes Later</h3>
<p>This isn’t a Hands Across America sort of post—no false platitudes. For us, the reason we built Plex was that we always loved getting lost in stories. Movies and TV shows, documentaries and anime, old favorites as well as wild new experiences. To share a personal guilty pleasure, in times like this we’re comforted by watching really bad, really stupid, “c’mon you can’t be seriously watching that” comedies. Other people curl up with a good zombie movie. Others binge all the reality shows that seemed so trite before but now just might be able to deliver a much-needed moment of zen. Whatever your go-to jam is, we hope you get a chance to take a break every now and again. Okay! Now on to the rest of our blog.</p>
<h3>First, if you’re an educator quickly adapting to online classes, Plex might be able to help<br />
</h3>
<p>To be clear, this is a bit of a stretch for us as we’re a relatively small company, but we have a platform that might be of value to educators out there. We are aware of a number of schools (and hospitals, churches, and even a submarine!) that have used Plex to stream licensed and teacher-generated videos in classrooms. We’ve recently helped a San Francisco Bay Area school that suddenly needed to figure out how to distribute this content remotely via tablets and web browsers. We were able to donate the costs associated with the remote software, as well as provide early access to a new feature we’re working on, single item sharing, so teachers can now share their playlists or specific content directly with their classes. If you’re an educational institution that may benefit from using Plex, email us details at <a href="mailto:edu@plex.tv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">edu@plex.tv</a> so we can understand what you are looking to do, assess the demand, and see how we might be able to help. </p>
<h3>A few tips on Remote Working, aka how to have a conference call in your kid’s closet</h3>
<p>From day one, we’ve been a completely remote company, working out the kinks of “working in your bedroom / dining room / garage / (hopefully sleeping) baby’s nursery” for the last 10 years. We’re spread across six different continents, so we’re well-versed in the tradeoffs of which time zone gets the short end of the stick to get up at 5 AM to make that conference call (sorry Team Australia). So at Plex, we’re all used to the hassle of video communication and with the paradise and the disaster that comes with working at home. For many of you, welcome to the new normal. If you’re new to the game, here’s <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/work-from-home?utm_source=plex&#038;utm_medium=plex-blog&#038;utm_campaign=plex-blog-this-is-fine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a great post with 47 specific WFH hacks</a> as well as a recent Forbes post (by our very own Keith Valory) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/03/25/communication-and-collaboration-the-keys-to-successful-remote-work/#6bba94212a0b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on setting up your business for WFH</a>.</p>
<h3>Okay, another thing. For the next 3 months, Live TV will be free—no Plex Pass required</h3>
<p>If you have an HD antenna and tuner, then now you can stream your free live TV to all your devices without Plex Pass through the end of June (DVR and other premium features still require a Plex Pass). And if you don’t, we got some of our hardware partners to offer them to Plex users <a href="https://www.plex.tv/ad/community-love-plex-fam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at a discount for a limited time</a>. You can stream reruns, new shows (treasure them!), news, or kids programming. Stream it all around your home or while you’re away.

<h3>(*) Other ways to help</h3>
<p>We’ll leave it to others more knowledgeable in your local communities and countries on how best to donate and support each other financially and emotionally. We do know many of you probably have some spare CPU and GPU cycles lying around, though, so we’d like to highlight an opportunity to put them to work with <a href="https://foldingathome.org/covid19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">folding@home</a> (feel free to join “<a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/249802" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Team Plex</a>” #249802 if you don’t already have a team). As they say, “Each simulation you run is like buying a lottery ticket. The more tickets we buy, the better our chances of hitting the jackpot.” So by all means, let’s go make some more lottery tickets.</p>
<h3>And if you’ve read this far, yes, we do have an Official Unofficial Plex Coloring Book for you to download</h3>
<p>The least we can do (and we mean that quite literally) is make a Plex coloring book. (Thanks again Team Australia!) After all the movies have been watched, board games have been played, podcasts have been, um, podded, and you get to that point of maximum boredom, we present to you the official unofficial Plex coloring book. Take your frustration out in colored pencil form. Print it out. Doodle. Draw. Or share your kid’s (or your) best efforts on Facebook or Instagram for a chance to earn some Plex swag. <a href="https://assets.plex.tv/marketing/coloring-book/plex-coloring-book-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we set out to build the best DVR and Live TV platform on the planet, we knew there would be challenges. We built a scheduling engine that reins in the multiverse by considering every possible recording schedule, then picking the best one, much like the <a href="https://www.space.com/40486-hawking-final-paper-physics.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">work of the late, great Stephen Hawking</a>. Tl;dr he found that the <em>Big Bang Theory</em> held strange implications for the multiverse, we say bring on the reruns! We built the smoothest DVR setup experience in the West to get you up and running with a bespoke program guide in no time. We built a sophisticated, multi-layer recording engine to let you tune in and time shift while ensuring your recordings continue without a hitch. You can even skip commercials.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, however, one cry has risen above the rest: &#8220;Can you PLEASE make a grid view?&#8221; (The cry often includes more profanity, but you get the idea.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; we thought. &#8220;Can&#8217;t be done.&#8221; Some of the greatest scientific minds had tried and failed. Then we did it. We think it turned out really nice. Go check it out today in Plex Web!</p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/air-human-plex-dvr-divine/">To Air is Human, Plex DVR is Divine</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.plex.tv">Plex</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Love is in the air. Well, not actual love per se, but the closest digital approximation, which is free, high definition media. In these days of wine, roses, and open WiFi networks, we tend to forget there&#8217;s an entire range of the spectrum (at least in the US) devoted to over-the-air broadcast TV. Outside of the US, we just assume you&#8217;re paying for Trump&#8217;s wall and have some sort of similar arrangement.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&#8217;ve been working hard to get all that content out of the air and into Plex. We all know the Millennials (you sweet, sweet snowflakes) haven’t been down with Cable TV since the get-go (#cordnevers ftw!) but it turns out the rest of us are cutting the cord in record numbers—to the tune of 24 million households in the US last year alone—and who are we to stand in the way of Progress?</p>
<p>Until today, the only way to get a really great DVR experience has been overpriced cable and satellite subscriptions, or bush league homebrew tools held together with bailing wire and duct tape. Needless to say, that needed to change.</p>
<p>Welcome to Plex DVR!</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce that Plex now officially offers integrated support for recording both over-the-air and cable broadcasts using HDHomeRun devices from our DVR launch partner, SiliconDust.* Available today as a <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/230212/">beta release on our forums</a> for our Plex Pass subscribers, rest assured this will be available as an automatic update for Plex Pass users before long.</p>
<p>With Plex DVR, you can cut the cord and take charge of your entertainment destiny. These glorious HD streams were meant to be free! So join the revolution, ride the wave, surf it, join our cause… Whatever you want to call it, it’s time to take the power back and create your own tailor-made media experience.</p>
<p>Ready to harness those sweet, sweet HD signals for your own benefit and enjoy them on your Plex app of choice? It really couldn’t be easier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab the latest Plex Media Server from our beta forum thread <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/230212/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Pick up an HDHomeRun device (don’t forget an antenna!) and plug it into your network. We’ve got a list of supported devices <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/225877427">here</a>.</li>
<li>Fire up Plex and head over to Settings -&gt; DVR to configure your tuner, input some location data for the programming guide, and get going.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what makes Plex DVR special? Well, actually, lots. Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>
<p><b>Crafted with immense care</b>: We had the best team on Earth working on the DVR. From the design, to the user experience, to the code under the hood, we&#8217;ve built something we&#8217;re incredibly proud of. We’ve even built in a little blinking 12:00 easter egg for you to find. This is an artisanal piece of goodness.</p>
<p><b>All the best data, for your data</b>: We licensed global program guide data for 71 countries from the best in the business: Gracenote. Given that data quality varies considerably around the world, we even put some extra magic into augmenting things like movie and show posters.</p>
<p><b>The easiest way to fill your server with content</b>: It&#8217;s ridiculously easy to subscribe to shows to make sure you never miss an episode, and we even let you subscribe to all your favorite team&#8217;s games with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><b>A match made in heaven</b>: If you haven&#8217;t noticed, Plex has grown over the better part of a decade into the best media solution on the planet (and we’re pretty sure none of the observable exoplanets have it beat either). This means you&#8217;ll instantly have the most advanced DVR in the known universe, which can sync recordings to a mobile device or the cloud, or stream them to a veritable cornucopia of apps across all sizes of screens. And of course our lovely universal search works seamlessly with it all. There&#8217;s never been a DVR like this.</p>
<p><b>Features with benefits</b>: In building the DVR, we added a bunch of cool features which benefit everyone using Plex. For example, we added a neat &#8220;garbage collection&#8221; feature which allows you to keep a fixed number of unwatched episodes for a show, or only recent episodes. We’ve also added the ability to sort individual shows by newest or oldest episodes and list all episodes at once regardless of season. (Note: full support for these features coming soon in some Plex clients)</p>
<p>* We’ll likely be offering more hardware support over time. YMMV. For best results pick up a supported device today.</p>
<p>Answers to (Soon to be) Frequently Asked Questions:</p>
<p><b>What does &#8220;Beta&#8221; mean?</b> This is a big, brand new feature that also relies on an external, third-party device. We expect that there may occasionally be some issues as we make DVR functionality available to a much wider user base. We&#8217;ll be working hard during the beta period to resolve issues and refine our DVR functionality.</p>
<p><b>Does it require a Plex Pass subscription?</b> Yes. DVR functionality is one of the many features and benefits that are available to our Plex Pass subscribers. The subscription enables our customers to enjoy premium program guide data for their Plex DVR and the very best Plex has to offer, including Mobile and Cloud Sync, Premium Music, full access to all Plex apps, parental controls, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>What about live TV or time-shifting?</strong> It is not currently possible to watch TV live or time-shift it before the recording has ended. Recordings must complete before they can be viewed. Live TV/time-shifting is an area in which we&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p><b>What tuners are supported?</b> Plex currently works with the SiliconDust HDHomeRun (HDHR) line of digital tuners (<a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/225877427">see details</a>). We&#8217;ll be investigating the possibility of supporting additional tuners as we move forward.</p>
<p><b>What about antenna support?</b> To receive over-the-air (OTA) TV programming, it is necessary to use a digital antenna with your HDHR. HDHR does not require a specific antenna and works with all brands and types. If you wrap your cat in tinfoil, that technically counts as an antenna but it&#8217;s up to you to keep him still for an entire <em>Modern Family</em>.</p>
<p><b>How do I configure and use Plex DVR?</b> While recorded DVR programs can be viewed from any Plex app, scheduling recordings and DVR configuration can only be performed using the Plex Web App. Which is written in React. And awesome. You can always access Plex Web at <a href="https://plex.tv/web">https://plex.tv/web</a> and manage recordings, even when you&#8217;re away from home.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to buy the HDHomeRun DVR Guide Data/Subscription?</strong> Nope! Electronic program guide (EPG) data is provided as part of the Plex Pass subscription; nothing separate required for guide data.</p>
<p>And last but not least: Barkley devouring a coconut just like you&#8217;re about to devour your cable plan. Enjoy!</p>
