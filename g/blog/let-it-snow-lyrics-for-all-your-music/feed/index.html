					<description><![CDATA[Hoping for a Blog update soon. Also had to go back a version or two on Plex Player and Server as it seemed very buggy. 
Hope a stable release is coming soon.

@joel  periods in files names should work fine. I have plenty like that myself. If you can post some details in our server support forums it would be appreciated]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Plex Team! Thank you for your AWESOME software! It makes my family happier and our lives more convenient on a daily basis. 

FWIW, I wanted to make one quick suggestion:  Please allow periods within file names. 

What I mean is any film which contains periods within the filename will not be recognized by the server (e.g., The.Matrix.1999.avi is not recognized).  While I have hundreds of videotapes and DVDs, rather than copy and transcode them, I often download them from online. Using periods to break up the filenames appear to be the convention adopted my most online. Again, FWIW. 

Regardless, thank you again!]]></description>

@lane In all of our player apps there is a quality setting where you can choose the streaming bandwidth. I&#039;m not sure what you mean if not that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seems like a pretty neat feature! Any idea when we&#039;ll get some more pressing features, such as the ability to adjust video buffers over the internet to make video watchable? This has been a feature request for over two years now and it seems like this core function has fallen by the wayside for incidental features such as this.]]></description>
