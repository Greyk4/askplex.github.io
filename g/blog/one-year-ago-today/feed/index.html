					<description><![CDATA[y&#039;know speaking of kicking Front Row&#039;s ass.... I realized there&#039;s occasionally the rare apple trailer that frontrow handles better, or sometimes a wmv that flip4mac deals with a bit better.  But thanks to plex&#039;s application launcher, I have it launch frontrow for those rare things, then back to plex, all with the one apple remote!  It&#039;s pretty seamless!

Sadly, due to xbmc and boxee using the same remote code; using plex as a launcher for those doesn&#039;t work quite so seamlessly [for say I want to check out hulu or something via boxee]; but maybe that could be tweaked in the future.  I am pretty pleased to use plex as my remote-control application launcher! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love Plex! Thank you guys.
Handling of bluray-movies is what I would like to happen in 2009. I am ripping my bluray movies to iso-files, and then watch them in Plex. It would be nice if subtitles and menues did work.]]></description>
