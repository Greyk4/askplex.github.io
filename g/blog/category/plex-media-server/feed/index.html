<h3>Together, but… not</h3>
<p>Hey. So, yeah, times are a little weird right now. We continue to hear from folks how Plex is making their lives a little better under the circumstances, and we couldn&#8217;t be more honored to be a part of that. Our friend Joe tweeted us with a great suggestion the other day:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/plex?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@plex</a> If you currently don’t have your code-ninjas working hard on a built-in ability to host watch parties using your system, I can’t understand why.<br />What an amazing gift to your current subscribers and opportunity to spread/promote the Plex love to a lot more eyeballs.</p>
<p>&mdash; Joe (@joepodell) <a href="https://twitter.com/joepodell/status/1261134735360884737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h3>Plot twist: Joe is a friggin’ mind reader</h3>
<p>It was timely. And a bit prescient. Joe, it turns out our code ninjas have been working hard on building exactly that. It&#8217;s less about getting eyeballs and more about letting people reconnect with each other remotely through the media they love, but credit where it&#8217;s due, Joe, for scooping us on the feature. Frankly, community—whether in-person or virtual—is something that we&#8217;ve all grown a new appreciation for over the past months. So yep, we&#8217;re right there with you.</p>

<h3>Make virtual movie dates a reality</h3>
<p>Today we&#8217;re announcing beta support for an experimental new feature we call <strong>Watch Together</strong>. Find a movie or episode you want to watch together, invite your friends on Plex (or even invite them to join Plex), and let us handle keeping playback in sync for everyone. It&#8217;s pretty great. No more &#8220;okay pressing play in 3, 2, 1&#8230;&#8221; or suffering through the third act in desperate need of a bathroom break. Anyone watching with you can play, pause, or seek around during the session. Before you ask, yes, “that guy” can ruin it for everyone. Pro tip: maybe don&#8217;t invite “<a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/movie/the-cable-guy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that guy</a>” to <strong>Watch Together</strong> with you.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/watch-together-screens-final.gif" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16390" /></p>
<h3>All together now</h3>
<p>As of today, <strong>Watch Together</strong> is supported on Apple platforms (iOS and tvOS), Android platforms (mobile and TV), FireTV, NVIDIA SHIELD and Roku – make sure to update to the latest release. Support for web and other platforms to follow soon. <strong>Watch Together</strong> works with both our free on-demand movies and TV shows and content from your personal media library.  So now your whole extended family can re-watch old videos of your kids playing sportsball even though your parents are thousands of miles away. Or binge on one of our free streaming TV shows (<a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/mary-berry-everyday" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mary Berry</a> anyone?) with your friends across town. It’s never been easier.  For this first iteration, choose your favorite non-Plex app to chat—video, audio, or text—to hang out while you watch. Pausing the movie on one device will pause it for everyone so that we all stay in sync and no one misses a beat.</p>
<h3>Safety not guaranteed</h3>
<p>Some notes: First, this is very much an experimental feature. There&#8217;s a metric tonne of improvements and integrations that we would love to add, and there are some sharp edges, but right now we&#8217;re mostly looking for feedback. How&#8217;s it working for you? Do you long for an integrated voice, text, or video chat? (Obviously, you can just fire up a Zoom or WhatsApp or Houseparty for the time being.) More power to invite additional audience members on the fly? The ability to kick/ban? (You invited “<a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/mr-bean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that guy</a>” didn&#8217;t you?) Maybe even a larger watch party where one or two folks “on the stage” do the speaking (like turning on the director’s commentary on your old faded BluRays)? How would you like to customize your personal viewing party? Let us know in the forums or comments below.</p>
<h3>Straight outta Plex Labs</h3>
<p><strong>Watch Together</strong> comes to you hot outta Plex Labs and will be free to everyone while it remains in official beta. No Plex Pass needed for the time being. So jump in, take it for a spin, and reconnect with some long lost friends over some old favorites or new discoveries.</p>
<p>You’ll find <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/watch-together/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">usage instructions</a> as well as answers to <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/frequently-asked-questions-watch-together/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frequently asked questions</a> on our support site. Something broken or irksome? You could always mention us in an angry tweet, but for best results we suggest you direct your feedback to our <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/tags/c/testing/plex-labs/16/watch-together" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">support forum</a>.</p>
<h3>So sync up, tune in, and chill out</h3>
<p>Give it a shot. Let us know what you think. More importantly, stay safe out there. Stay home. And Watch Together.</p>

<p>Yeah, well you can skip all that now.</p>

<h3>Binge-watching nirvana</h3>
<p>Introducing our brand new Plex Pass feature called (duh) Skip Intro. If you’ve ever binge-watched anything, you know the secret to achieving that smooth multi-episode groove is all about reducing the non-essentials. So our engineers sharpened their pencils and, um, slid their slide-rules in order to figure out how to dynamically skip intros for basically any type of show. That is, without having to manually identify on every single episode what is an opening intro and what is just a kick-ass music break at the start of an episode. When you add in cold-opens, different credits for different seasons, and regional variations, it starts to become a rather thorny problem. </p>
<p>Long story short, we updated your Plex Media Server to analyze your shows in the background in order to deliver some next-level pattern recognition. Once it&#8217;s finished processing, you&#8217;ll see that friendly <strong>Skip Intro</strong> button appear in your supported player app. Magic.</p>
<h3>To boldly go where no DVR has gone before</h3>
<p>Think of it as another reason to get that digital antenna and tuner and set up Plex Live TV and DVR. In addition to watching and recording dozens of HD over-the-air broadcast channels for FREE (here in the States that includes networks like CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX, and PBS plus dozens more depending on your local market), now you can skip intros on all of your recorded shows. Only two caveats: the intro sequence must be at least 20 seconds long (keep reading to see why) and you’ll need a Plex Pass for your playback device. As of today, you’ll see it working on the latest releases of our iOS, Android, Roku, Fire TV, and Web clients – once you’ve updated your Plex Media Server and let it process your TV content.</p>
<h3>Show me the histograms</h3>
<p>A little peek under the hood: The secret ingredient is creating an audio &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; out of the histogram of each episode in a given season of each TV show. It turns out that the vast majority of show intros share common audio signatures for all their episodes (at least for a specific season). After applying some heuristics and a little bit of Special Sauce<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, we&#8217;re able to predict (in almost all cases) precisely when the intro starts and ends. Voila! Get precious minutes of your life back, one episode at a time.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Um. Suffice it to say that a lot has happened since we last blogged a few months back. This may not be your typical Plex blog post, but it’ll probably be one of the least crazy things to happen today. </p>
<p>Quite a few of you have reached out to share how much Plex has helped over the past weeks and how it fits in to your shelter-in-place regimen, whether it’s keeping kids from tearing each other’s hair out, or keeping family and friends fed with a steady stream of media to pass the time. To be clear, we’re on the far fringes of being able to make a meaningful contribution to returning things to normal. While we’re not working on the cure*, we’re incredibly honored to know that we’re working on something that may make the mitigation a little more tolerable for all of you. It gives us a renewed sense of purpose. We won’t let you down.</p>
<h3>28 <del>Days</del> <del>Hours</del> Minutes Later</h3>
<p>This isn’t a Hands Across America sort of post—no false platitudes. For us, the reason we built Plex was that we always loved getting lost in stories. Movies and TV shows, documentaries and anime, old favorites as well as wild new experiences. To share a personal guilty pleasure, in times like this we’re comforted by watching really bad, really stupid, “c’mon you can’t be seriously watching that” comedies. Other people curl up with a good zombie movie. Others binge all the reality shows that seemed so trite before but now just might be able to deliver a much-needed moment of zen. Whatever your go-to jam is, we hope you get a chance to take a break every now and again. Okay! Now on to the rest of our blog.</p>
<h3>First, if you’re an educator quickly adapting to online classes, Plex might be able to help<br />
</h3>
<p>To be clear, this is a bit of a stretch for us as we’re a relatively small company, but we have a platform that might be of value to educators out there. We are aware of a number of schools (and hospitals, churches, and even a submarine!) that have used Plex to stream licensed and teacher-generated videos in classrooms. We’ve recently helped a San Francisco Bay Area school that suddenly needed to figure out how to distribute this content remotely via tablets and web browsers. We were able to donate the costs associated with the remote software, as well as provide early access to a new feature we’re working on, single item sharing, so teachers can now share their playlists or specific content directly with their classes. If you’re an educational institution that may benefit from using Plex, email us details at <a href="mailto:edu@plex.tv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">edu@plex.tv</a> so we can understand what you are looking to do, assess the demand, and see how we might be able to help. </p>
<h3>A few tips on Remote Working, aka how to have a conference call in your kid’s closet</h3>
<p>From day one, we’ve been a completely remote company, working out the kinks of “working in your bedroom / dining room / garage / (hopefully sleeping) baby’s nursery” for the last 10 years. We’re spread across six different continents, so we’re well-versed in the tradeoffs of which time zone gets the short end of the stick to get up at 5 AM to make that conference call (sorry Team Australia). So at Plex, we’re all used to the hassle of video communication and with the paradise and the disaster that comes with working at home. For many of you, welcome to the new normal. If you’re new to the game, here’s <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/work-from-home?utm_source=plex&#038;utm_medium=plex-blog&#038;utm_campaign=plex-blog-this-is-fine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a great post with 47 specific WFH hacks</a> as well as a recent Forbes post (by our very own Keith Valory) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/03/25/communication-and-collaboration-the-keys-to-successful-remote-work/#6bba94212a0b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on setting up your business for WFH</a>.</p>
<h3>Okay, another thing. For the next 3 months, Live TV will be free—no Plex Pass required</h3>
<p>If you have an HD antenna and tuner, then now you can stream your free live TV to all your devices without Plex Pass through the end of June (DVR and other premium features still require a Plex Pass). And if you don’t, we got some of our hardware partners to offer them to Plex users <a href="https://www.plex.tv/ad/community-love-plex-fam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at a discount for a limited time</a>. You can stream reruns, new shows (treasure them!), news, or kids programming. Stream it all around your home or while you’re away. Maybe it will help educate, entertain, enlighten, or another e-starting-word. <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/live-tv-over-the-air-functionality-free-for-the-next-3-months/561368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Get the details here</a>. We’ve been working especially hard to fix lots of issues with Live TV based on thoughtful feedback from the community. Stay tuned for more details on that soon.<br />

<h3>(*) Other ways to help</h3>
<p>We’ll leave it to others more knowledgeable in your local communities and countries on how best to donate and support each other financially and emotionally. We do know many of you probably have some spare CPU and GPU cycles lying around, though, so we’d like to highlight an opportunity to put them to work with <a href="https://foldingathome.org/covid19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">folding@home</a> (feel free to join “<a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/249802" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Team Plex</a>” #249802 if you don’t already have a team). As they say, “Each simulation you run is like buying a lottery ticket. The more tickets we buy, the better our chances of hitting the jackpot.” So by all means, let’s go make some more lottery tickets.</p>
<h3>And if you’ve read this far, yes, we do have an Official Unofficial Plex Coloring Book for you to download</h3>
<p>The least we can do (and we mean that quite literally) is make a Plex coloring book. (Thanks again Team Australia!) After all the movies have been watched, board games have been played, podcasts have been, um, podded, and you get to that point of maximum boredom, we present to you the official unofficial Plex coloring book. Take your frustration out in colored pencil form. Print it out. Doodle. Draw. Or share your kid’s (or your) best efforts on Facebook or Instagram for a chance to earn some Plex swag. <a href="https://assets.plex.tv/marketing/coloring-book/plex-coloring-book-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.<br />

<h3>Togethertude</h3>
<p>So in closing, during this period of uncertainty, hopefully you’ve got some family with you, some friends, or at least on-screen companions reaching out from their own couches, a town, or a country over. Just know we’ll be joining you, finding a moment of escape and perhaps even the briefest but most delicious slice of joy. Stay safe out there (or more likely, in there). We’re here for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not gonna lie, it’s been a big couple of weeks for us. We launched a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/boom-we-just-dinosized-your-movie-collection-for-free/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pretty major new thing</a> just about a week ago. It was a big effort. However, many pointed out that it’s a little bit outside of our comfort zone, and well, you’re not wrong. It’s an area of growth that we’re excited about and pushes Plex into brave, new, and exciting waters. We’re also pumped that it delivers on our long-term vision of bringing all the media you and your family enjoy into a single platform. One powerful, beautiful, and customizable platform that works smoothly and consistently no matter where and how you stream.<br />

<p style="font-size: .9em; font-style: italic; margin-top: -30px !important; text-align: center; color: #b3bac1;">Our 2012 Roku app, showing all your media in one place</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as is the way of logic on the internet, some folks went on to proclaim this the “End of Plex”: it’s only a matter of time (or so the thinking goes) before we kick our loyal Media Server users to the curb in pursuit of glorious, ad-supported world domination. Well, we can very clearly state that nothing could be further from the truth. Personal media is the very core of that long-term vision, and we’re just as invested as you in making it a reality.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at some of the major improvements we’ve made over the past year.</p>
<h3>First, some core playback improvements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced and expanded playback capabilities on Android, Apple TV, and iOS.</li>
<li>Best-in-class media players on Android, iOS and Apple TV, bringing better format support, smoother playback, and overall higher quality viewing.</li>
<li>Expanded and improved support for hardware-accelerated transcoding.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next, a bunch of music-related goodness:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/find-that-tune/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Greatly improved music features</a>, scanning, and metadata.</li>
<li>TIDAL integration, including the ability to “add to library,” making TIDAL music your own.</li>
<li>Automatically find related albums and tracks for movies and TV episodes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Completed our <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/uno-everywhere/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new UI</a> rollout across all devices. It Just Works for almost everyone, and customizable everywhere else.</li>

<p>And these are just some of the highlights among dozens of little features and hundreds of bug fixes, all in support of making Plex the best thing on the planet for your media.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to gently dispel some of the more fantastical doomsday rumors that have bubbled their way through the series of tubes. Bonus points if I can clear up some actual misconceptions along the way.</p>
<p>First, we’re as committed as ever to the needs of our media-loving, server-owning, fiercely independent community who’s been with us from the beginning. We don’t take this community for granted, and believe me, we’d sooner give up our phones (uh, no) than drive you away.</p>
<p>Second, our goal is to prioritize your personal media first, and add this new, free media as an optional supplement to you and your family. Your library is still front and center, but now there’s more to choose from if you happen to come up short. Managing multiple sources can be a bit of a tightrope act at times, and (believe it or not!) we may encounter a bug or two along the way. Have a real-world example where we got it wrong? Know that we’re listening and always trying to improve. Feedback is always welcome and appreciated. Oh, and if you or your family play things from one of these new sources, it will have no performance impact at all on your server; it comes straight from us. </p>
<p>Third—and this should <a href="https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">go without saying</a>—we do not collect information about the contents of your personal library. We do not run ads against your personal media. We don’t share this info with anyone (given we don’t know it in the first place, how could we?). Nothing here has changed with the rollout of free movies &#038; TV.</p>
<p>So there you have it. We’re excited about where this next year will take us on all fronts. As you know, everyone at Plex uses and loves the product on a daily basis. So trust us when we say that we’re continuing to build the product and the company to be something that we’re all proud of and that everyone genuinely enjoys using: old-timers, new-timers, and even the crotchety internet tube users as well. Plex is a lifelong labor of love—we thank you all for helping us dream big and keep our aim true.</p>

<p>Wow. Today is the day we’ll start streaming thousands of free movies, TV shows, extreme sports films, music documentaries, Bollywood musicals, and more. Some super familiar stuff (Hey there, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/?forwardUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.plex.tv%2Fdesktop%23!%2Fprovider%2Ftv.plex.provider.vod%2Fdetails%3Fkey%3D%252Flibrary%252Fmetadata%252F5dd151adeb43ea001f55d4a4%26context%3Dhub.search.movie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nic Cage</a>!

All of this goodness is ready to go as soon as you open Plex.</p>
<p>While there might be, oh, one or two other streaming services already out there <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, we’re building on our decade of extreme passion for media to deliver the best experience possible, while also giving you the control and customization to stream it your way. So dip your toes in and give it a whirl! As with all the Plex content offerings, you can move the free movie source up and down your sidebar or even hide it forever—you’re always in control of your own destiny, or at least your own interface.</p>

<p>Over time, we’ll be adding more stuff from different studios and creators—from Oscar-winning Hollywood movies to the latest from India, Russia, China, Japan, Africa, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe to really cool independent movies fresh off the festival circuit. For those who are into acronyms—looking at all you <a href="https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/?forwardUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.plex.tv%2Fdesktop%23!%2Fprovider%2Ftv.plex.provider.vod%2Fdetails%3Fkey%3D%252Flibrary%252Fmetadata%252F5dc3e985bd63ba002284910a%26context%3Dhub.search.movie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SCUBA heads</a> and <a href="https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/?forwardUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.plex.tv%2Fdesktop%23!%2Fprovider%2Ftv.plex.provider.vod%2Fdetails%3Fkey%3D%252Flibrary%252Fmetadata%252F5dd774e35997dc001de7fd32%26context%3Dhub.search.movie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NASA geeks</a>—this type of offering is known as <strong>A</strong>d-supported <strong>V</strong>ideo <strong>O</strong>n <strong>D</strong>emand, or AVOD. Our hope is that Plex becomes your favorite source for free shows and movies, which will all be available across the vast expanse of Plex-enabled devices. And all, you know, for free.</p>
<h3>Okay. So how exactly does this new free service work?</h3>
<p><strong>1. If you already have content inside Plex:</strong> Congrats! Your mediaverse just got a little bit bigger. New free movies and series content will be available in your navigation and homescreen just like all of your other media in Plex, which you can customize or turn off. We&#8217;ll also be able to recommend content based on your media collection, just like we do with your music library and TIDAL. You decide whether you want to watch any of the recommended free titles.</p>
<p><strong>2. If you don&#8217;t have content inside Plex:</strong> It&#8217;s now easier than ever to experience the highest-rated media app around. Enjoy our best-in-class interface for streaming the movies, TV shows, podcasts, documentaries, and music you love. No hard drive or personal media collection necessary. We’ll bring all the good stuff directly to you.</p>
<h3>So, about those little ad-breaks in the free movies and TV shows</h3>
<p>Our goal is to bring this great content from big studios and independent producers from around the globe to you for free. In exchange, we’re asking for a bit of your time to watch some ads. We think it’s a fair deal, but of course, you’ll be the judge.</p>
<p>Besides—you gotta go to the bathroom sometime, right? </p>

<h3>Wait, are you going to be putting ads in my personal content?</h3>
<p>Absolutely not! That would be a really terrible idea for many, many reasons. Your media collection—including your recorded movies and TV shows, home videos, photos, music collection, and more—will continue to stream to all of your devices ad-free. Unless, of course, you just happen to collect TV commercials in your personal media collection <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p>
<h3>Boldly streaming where no other company has streamed before</h3>
<p>While there are certainly other free streaming services out there, we’re the first to offer a vast, free, diverse collection of content for a truly global audience. Starting today, Plex will deliver more content to more countries than any other free streaming service to date. We wanted to offer more entertainment—both classics and new favorites—and do so in a way that is high-quality (for those who care about encoding quality) while serving only about one-third the amount of ads you’d expect on cable television.</p>
<p>Basically, we wanted to build a free streaming service that we would want to watch ourselves. And of course, Plex isn&#8217;t only a free streaming service. We provide you and your family a single, beautiful place to curate and stream all your stored videos and photos, favorite podcasts, movies, web shows, news, live TV, and even your carefully curated music collection. In other words, with Plex you become master of your mediaverse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago we <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/remastered-thanks-to-you-our-brand-new-tv-navigation-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spelled out</a> some imminent changes to our TV UI, and intimated that great things were to come across the board. “UNO is the future!” we said (“UNO” being our internal code name for the new UI paradigm across all platforms). None of us quite knew why “UNO” was capitalized since it’s not an acronym. “Blame Jason!” we said, and Jason was asleep at the time, so we went with it.</p>
<h3>So what is all this hullabaloo about UNO anyway?</h3>
<p>In case you missed it, UNO is our latest effort to streamline the process of searching, discovering and enjoying your content in your Plex library—no matter the type, no matter the source, no matter the format. It’s an easy, elegant, and powerful system that’s consistent no matter where and how you Plex. It gives you the ultimate control over how you navigate your collection.</p>
<h3>Benefits include: Niftier navigation</h3>
<p>We restore some basic usability qualities that suffered a bit under our “type-first” implementation.</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/navigating-the-big-screen-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fewer clicks to get where you want to go.</a></li>
<li>More discoverable actions and sources.</li>
<li>More intuitive navigation patterns.</li>
<li>Fewer distractions with things you shouldn’t have to care about.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ownership and customization</h3>
<p>You have <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-the-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complete control</a> over your navigation—you tell Plex what you care about, we build an experience for you, and if you don’t like it, you can rearrange sources, hide sources, add or remove rows from your home screen, and more.</p>

<h3>A powerful new sidebar</h3>
<p>In addition to being a better use of screen space than the top menu, it lets you see all the stuff you care about, none of the stuff you don’t, and it gets out of the way when you don’t need to look at it.</p>
<h3>Rolling out wide across the Plexverse</h3>
<p>Fast forward a few months, and now we’re on the precipice of realizing that very vision: the UNO UI is rolling out across all TV platforms this week, it’s <em>super</em> close on iOS and coming thereafter on Android, but importantly this marks the mainstream release of our most sacred (and challenging!) release of all: our beloved Web app.</p>
<h3>Which brings us to our friendly neighborhood Web app</h3>
<p>The Plex Web app is a bit of a special beast, since it serves as both a super popular platform for consuming media and the singular app to admin and curate your Media Servers. We’re fairly confident this app embodies the best of both worlds: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-plex-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimate customization</a> for the media consumer and improved control and curation for the server owner and administrator. It’s always a fun balancing act between the two—and many thanks to everyone who has given feedback along the way.</p>

<p>So go forth and customize! Embrace the sources you love best! Relegate the others to the “More” menu! (It’s okay, I’m pretty sure they won’t be offended <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f937-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) The reins of your media future rest loosely in your hands… YAH!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahoy Plexverse! We hope the season finds you well (hot and beachy in the northern hemisphere, cool and snow-shoey in the southern). Life here is good, we’ve been heads-down on fixing bugs and adding features, as always. The new <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/remastered-thanks-to-you-our-brand-new-tv-navigation-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNO</a> UI is coming to more platforms, we’re intensely focused on a giant metadata overhaul that we’re really excited about, we’ve added the ability to cast to SONOS devices and support for third-party Alexa-powered devices, and we’ve stomped some especially annoying server bugs: Live TV timeouts, several elusive crashes, some cases where we didn’t fall back from hardware to software transcoding, and some major improvements (orders of magnitude in fact) to partial scanning on some larger libraries, among others.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-11932 lazy" style="border-bottom: solid 1px #E0E3E6; padding-bottom: 0px !important;" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-800x445.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-800x445.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-768x427.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-1024x570.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-1800x1002.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-1440x801.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-640x356.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-400x223.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-phone-notifications-1-150x83.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>One thing we’ve been wanting to add for eons now is server notifications. Literally for so long that when we started talking about it, push notifications didn’t exist and we would have had to use pagers. Sadly there are <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382578/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very few titles</a> which are pager-friendly and thankfully along came real push notifications.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11938" style="width: 100%;" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-blog-plex-knows-notifications-pager.gif" alt="" /><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: .9em;">&#8220;Can I ask you a question? Do you know if the hotel is pager-friendly?&#8221; <em>The Hangover</em></span></p>
<p>We’ve been honing this feature for a while, and we’re finally launching it today! Super easy to get up and running—just flip the switch in your Media Server settings, and you’ll start getting notifications for new On Deck media and a few critical server maintenance events. Head over to your iOS or Android device and you can customize the notifications you’d like to receive to your heart’s content. Want to be notified any time your kid plays something? No problem! Want to know about all the movies your hipster cinephile sister adds to her server? Go for it. New media notifications work great for shared servers and users, too!</p>

<p>We’ve also added notifications around some key server maintenance tasks you can opt into, such as notifying you when your database is backed up, or for our security-minded server admins, new users accessing your server for the first time from a new device. Note: new content and server notifications are only sent for servers that have opted in.</p>
<p>For the automation fans out there, these new events will also trigger webhooks, so you can use them for all sorts of cool projects. Build something neat with webhooks? Let us know so we can feature it!</p>
<p>Push notifications are available now as a Plex Pass preview.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it’s already April, which somehow scored the three biggest holidays of the year. Seriously, March and August have got to be facepalming themselves with frustration, wondering how April got all the coolness. What other month do you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay the piper</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2019/apr/01/april-fools-day-2019-the-best-jokes-and-pranks-in-one-place" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fool the piper</a>, and <a href="https://giphy.com/explore/420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smoke the piper</a> all within a thirty-day blur?</p>
<p>It also means April happens to be the perfect time to talk about how we’ve added a bit more kick to our already-tasty TIDAL x Plex musical brew with some spicy new enhancements. And to demonstrate exactly how smooth and flavorful this cocktail is, watch as we serve it up to an unsuspecting music aficionado whose universe – and quite possibly his very conception of reality – is about to be completely rocked in sixty seconds flat.</p>

<em>by Hugh Newell</em></p>
<h3>In which we introduce Hector, the hero of our story</h3>
<p>Meet my friend Hector. He’s what you call a <a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/who-are-the-musicians-musicians.497702/page-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">musician’s musician</a>. As well as a fan’s fan. And of course he’s <em>also</em> a waiter’s waiter because, well, the first two things.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hector has been using Plex for well on three and a half years. And he likes to tell me (in between the <em>amuse bouche</em> and the <em>antipasto</em> courses at the rather delicious Italian restaurant he’s working at) that he loves Plex and has tweaked all of his album art to make his library a living monument to Shag (the <a href="http://www.shag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artist</a>, not the <a href="https://flashbak.com/shag-carpet-and-the-sleazy-seventies-19216/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">carpet</a>, though at a certain point in the evening it all kinda becomes one and the same in an <a href="http://www.faberhama.com/Ouroboros-Rug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ouroboros</a> sorta way). After he sweeps away our garlic-soaked crumbs, Hector declares that he is a huge fan of Steely Dan (the band, not William S. Burrough’s prop that, er, electrifies the masterful <em>Naked Lunch</em>).</p>
<p>And I say to him (YES WITH MY MOUTH FULL BECAUSE THIS POINT IS <em>THAT</em> IMPORTANT) “Sure, right, you’re a big Steely Dan fan. But does your library have ‘Everyone’s Gone to the Movies (Demo Version)’?</p>
<p>And he stares down at his fancy Italian leather shoes and you can see his face turn the slightest shade of <em>primavera</em> red, and being the kinda guy who doesn’t want to embarrass friends and waiters, I said, “Hey Nineteen, don’t feel Deacon blue.” Two quick song title references helped lighten the mood up a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2017/10/13/steely-dan-walter-becker-peg-aja-670103.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peg</a>. “I can show you how you can complete your collection in like 60 seconds.”</p>
<p>Hector’s all like, “You’re on.” (But he says it with an Italian accent, because you know, this is a really nice Italian restaurant where everyone speaks with an Italian accent). He continues, “I’ve Plexed my van. It’s out back.”</p>
<p>I say “Oh, you mean like <em>now</em>, now?”</p>
<p>“Yup. I’ve got 60 seconds before table 12 gets their <em>spumoni</em>.” And then he drops his voice a whole 12 tone octave, and says in a gravelly Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Western sort of way: “Or is your whole ‘Plex is the greatest ultra-hi-fidelity music augmentation experience the world has ever known’ claim just a bunch of marketing bunk?”</p>
<h3>A mid-meal wager is placed</h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it was on. And that’s how approximately 22 seconds later, I found myself in Hector’s van betwixt my <em>primo</em> and <em>secondo</em>. I told my dining companion to pick out a nice victory red from the wine list whilst I was away. That’s how real this just got.</p>
<h3>Yes, I got into the van</h3>
<p>Now, don’t worry &#8211; this van was one of those strangely nice Sprinter style vans that had been retrofitted into a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vanlife/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#vanlife</a> sort of vibe that you see popping up on the Instagrams of ultra-hip and attractive people who are also seemingly deeply under-employed. Rest assured, Hector had a halfway decent wifi connection, as well as a rather <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stupid-ipad-accessories-2012-5#a-maxi-pad-for-your-ipad-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impressively decorated</a> iPad Air.</p>
<p>So, just to be clear, despite the preceding set up, it was <strong>not</strong> weird. Or at least, not <em>that</em> weird. Now, did Hector have a few pet reptiles in his van? Maybe yes. But putting Hector in jeopardy with <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/64/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Customs</a> for the unlicensed importation of exotic reptiles is not the point of this post. It’s the transformation of Hector’s Plex music library (and by extension his entire way of life) in a scant 60 seconds – <em>that’s</em> the point of this post. So let’s stop obsessing about the little purple chameleons, okay?</p>
<p>Pulling out a suspiciously placed old-timey stop watch from his trouser pocket, Hector nodded to me, and said, “Do your thing, magic man.” Now to be clear, that’s not my <em>actual</em> name, but given that I was on the clock, I didn’t want to waste time clarifying my bona fides. We had a library to augment and a mind to blow, after all.</p>
<h3>Enter an ocean of music</h3>
<p>So, first thing we did after Hector started his big nickel-plated <a href="https://newatlas.com/birthday-200th-stopwatch/43431/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stop watch</a> (that looked exactly like the one from <em>60 MINUTES</em> that you see before Andy Rooney starts to rant about how he can never find a stapler when he’s in the bathroom) was to launch the Plex app on his iPad.</p>
<p>Cool, we’re just 4 seconds in and already halfway there. Then I said, “Okay, show me The Dan.” And he navigated to his Steely Dan collection for me, and if I could just give Hector some props, it was an IMPRESSIVE display of custom album art. He was truly a master curator. Okay, enough with the praise, I got a <em>secondo</em> to start.</p>
<p>His Steely Dan library prior to massive Plex augmentation looked like this:</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11674 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1024x768.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-300x225.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-768x576.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1800x1350.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1440x1080.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-800x600.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-640x480.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-400x300.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-150x113.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag.png 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>And then while he was talking about that one time he <em>almost</em> met Shag at a gallery in Silver Lake, I told Hector to go to <a href="https://www.plex.tv/music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plex.tv/music</a> and click on the <strong>Get 30 Days Free</strong> button to activate his TIDAL x Plex trial. He shot me a classic left eyebrow arch and asked the timeless question: “Bro, you sure?”</p>
<p>And I said to him, “<em>Absolument, mon frère.</em>” Which isn’t Italian because I took French in high school, but he got the gist anyway. “First month is free, so if it doesn’t turn you on, you can always turn it off. No harm, no foul.”</p>
<h3>Hungry for a FLAC attack</h3>
<p>So, on the Plex <a href="https://www.plex.tv/music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, Hector chose the HiFi edition for his free trial, which delivers something like sixty million tracks in FLAC format, plus 250,000 music videos.</p>
<p>I smiled: “Check out your new Dan, man.”</p>
<p>And lo and behold gentle reader, when his Steely Dan page refreshed (remind you, we’re only at 18 seconds into this 60 second challenge), he saw this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11663" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steely-dan-add-to-library.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hector gave me a look that said, “Oh my ever-loving god, what black magic is this?” I shot him back a look that implied, “Oh, I guess you just completed your collection with a single click.”</p>
<h3>I casually Venn-diagrammed the concept of awesomeness</h3>
<p>And now we’re at 24 seconds, so I decided to do a little showboating. “Scroll past the TIDAL ALBUMS and you’ll see PLEX RECOMMENDATIONS ON TIDAL.” Hector pondered the list. “Wait. That’s not Steely Dan. Who are these guys? ”</p>
<p>By way of response, I held onto his shoulder, stuck my arm in front of both of us, and did that majestic hand-sweeping-thing in front of his face like Howard Hughes introducing the Spruce Goose: “These are all the artists who <em>sound</em> like Steely Dan but&#8230;” and this <em>but</em> was so significant i had to say it twice, “&#8230; but <em>you</em> don’t have in <em>your</em> library. Yet.” I enunciated the final word in my best movie trailer voice. We both shivered. But it could have been his wicked powerful sub-arctic AC he modded his van with.</p>
<p>Seriously, is he transporting organs in this thing?</p>
<h3>Discover musical discovery with our nifty discovering tools</h3>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11664 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1024x973.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1024x973.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-300x285.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-768x730.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1800x1711.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1440x1369.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-800x761.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-640x608.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-400x380.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-150x143.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation.png 2026w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>And then at 35 seconds into this process of meta-musical transcendence (it was Easter Sunday after all), I said, “Go ahead and click on Discovery Radio button. This is the music that is guaranteed <em>not</em> to be in your library, but similar to the songs that <em>are</em> already in your library. It’s like discovering a parallel universe of music that you already love.”</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11667 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1024x717.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1024x717.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1800x1261.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1440x1008.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-800x560.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-640x448.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-400x280.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-150x105.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations.jpg 2022w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>He whispered to me like we’ve finally laid eyes on a golden Idol hidden in the far reaches of a spider-infested cave, “So I can get my Dan on <em>without</em> listening to Steely Dan?” And I do that classic move where I create a Venn diagram out of a handy set of tropical mango-scented Sharpies. “Think of Discovery Radio as your favorite band’s favorite tracks – that you’ve never heard of.”</p>
<p>“My favorite’s favorites…” muttered Hector. And I chuckled knowingly to myself: Hombre, we haven’t even begun to explore the cosmos of augmentation possibilities.</p>
<h3>Can an augmented music library actually win back your ex-girlfriend? We report, you decide</h3>
<p>I continued to take him down the rabbit hole with me. “Now get ready for some brand new features we’re launching this week on Android mobile &amp; TV, Apple TV, iPhone and iPad, according to <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/add-tidal-content-to-your-plex-music-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the details on our support site</a>.” In a burst of anticipation, Hector raised his eyebrows like two fuzzy caterpillars, which immediately caught the attention of his little chameleon friends. It was cute and weird all at the same time &#8211; such is #vanlife I suppose.</p>
<p>I continued, “Go to an artist that you’ve only added one album from, probably because your ex-girlfriend’s boyfriend says he was kinda into them that one time you ran into the two love-birds at the <a href="https://www.travelchannel.com/interests/shopping/articles/worlds-best-flea-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flea Market</a> and you just wanted to see what kinda stuff this new guy was made of.”</p>
<p>And Hector said with grim determination, “Yeah. That’d be The Mars Volta.”</p>
<p>I thought to myself, man you are <em>never</em> winning your ex-girlfriend back from a guy with strong music taste like that, but I kept this insight to myself because that’s not <em>my</em> journey in life, nor my quest in the back of this van. To reiterate: my singular goal is to expand minds and augment libraries. And so that’s what I did.</p>
<p>“Cool. <em>Now</em> look up that Mars Volta in your new augmented Plex, and <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Get_Schwifty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show me what you got</a>.” And Hector did so and grinned like he’s just made a hole-in-one in the golf course of life. “Instantly add a few of those deep cuts to your library and blast them outside your ex-girlfriend&#8217;s house sometime.” And he looked at me and said “Add them?” And I was all like, “Yep. You can now <em>add</em> albums from TIDAL right to your native Plex library.”</p>
<h3>And now all eyes turn to thee, Artist TV</h3>
<p>And before he could even process that wizardry, I one-upped myself by hitting him with yet another crazy super-power we’re launching this week. “So you know how you got your Artist Radio? Well <em>now</em> you got Artist TV too on Android mobile &amp; TV, Apple TV, iOS devices.”</p>
<p>He was like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4dZCUtq-yI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>what the freak</em></a>? And even though we only had 12 seconds remaining, I said, “Yep, turn it on and crank it up!” And then boom, he had Steely Dan TV, right there in his van. It’s like <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/most-memorable-moments-from-total-request-live/brandon-michaels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Total Request Live</a> from the old days, but instead of being in Times Square with the dangerously low energy Carson Daly, it’s now in the palm of your hand. Or on the wall of your home. Or on the front of your, uh, tablet. Anyway, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/apps-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you get the picture</a>.</p>
<p>You could say Hector’s jaw dropped. Because it did. Which is why you can say that. Because this post, my friends, is 100% fact-based journalism. The features by which Hector’s Steely Dan-loving mind were blown are available to you as well. Just try it out. And might I repeat our mantra?

<h3>About that victory glass of red wine…</h3>
<p>So as I slid back into the restaurant booth, our Branzino arrived (bone-in because it’s that kinda joint) and I smiled at my dining companion. If only she knew the magical worlds Hector and I had just spelunked through in the van.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not an April Fool’s story, nor is it a tale powered by 420, nor even is it a special top secret <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-technology-do-you-think-the-US-government-is-currently-hiding-from-the-public-and-what-are-examples-of-previously-classified-technologies-that-were-later-declassified-and-sold-in-civilian-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">government weapons-grade robotic augmentation project</a> that your mighty tax dollars are funding. Nope. It’s just the same awesome Plex you use and love every month of the year. And now especially in April.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re thrilled to announce that our new big-screen interface is now available for Roku users in the Roku channel store, and it’s also now available as a <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/apple-tv-beta-with-uno-ui/393124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta for Apple TV</a>!</p>
<p>The new UI represents months of hard work, extensive user testing, and ongoing conversation with our community. It’ll continue to be a focus of our efforts as we work to bring the new conventions to our other big-screen and mobile apps, but we’re super happy with the reception to date. Want to know more about how we got here? Read on, and we’ll give you the backstory…</p>

<p>The UI in our apps has been through a few major changes in its time. These have been driven by the shifting needs of the Plex ecosystem, which has become increasingly vast and feature-rich over the years.</p>
<p>These transitions can be a little painful for some, and (believe us!) we do our very best to balance the needs of everyone from the most intense Plex-head running seven servers in their closet (we know you’re out there!) to your grandma or roommate who just wants to check out the odd episode of Friends from time to time (I’m told it didn’t age well). Sometimes we’ve managed to nail these transitions perfectly, and sometimes, unfortunately, we haven’t.</p>
<p>If you’re old enough to remember Plex’s <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/release-007-let-there-be-mini-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">embryonic form OSXBMC</a>, you’ll remember those were simpler times. You plugged a hard drive into your Mac Mini, your Mini into your only TV, stuck your media on that sucker, and played away. There was no server. Our phones still had keypads. These were dark days.</p>

<p>As it became clear that the Future was going to be multi-screened, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/the-road-to-plexnine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we created the Plex Media Server</a>, and turned OSXBMC into a lightweight app which could access it. There’s no question this was a Good Move, but hey, it added some complexity. We stuck with it, our lovely community of dedicated Plexians stuck with it, and I think you’ll agree we’re all better off.</p>
<p>When we introduced our <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/introducing-myplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">service in the cloud</a> (anyone remember “myPlex”?), it unlocked some pretty awesome capabilities. Now you could easily stream from anywhere, and it meant you could share your stuff with family and friends. Pretty spiffy, but our apps were built under the assumption that you had one local server available to you. Shared stuff was all sort of shoehorned off into a corner of the app, and if you wanted to browse it, you got a big flat list. Not so great. So we undertook a redesign effort that we internally thought of as “server-first”—now you could pick the server you wanted to browse, and when you did, you got a first class experience. Again, this introduced a little bit of complexity for some folks who really did have a single, local server. So it wasn’t without its tradeoffs, but again, in the end we think it was worth it.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and we wanted to start dipping our toes in some new streams of content (see what I did there?) that we could bring to all of you wonderful folks in a first class way, as well as people who didn’t have their own server at all. We also realized that it was more likely that you’d have more server-based sources available. Both of these realities posed a challenge to our “server-first” navigation. Streaming content, of course, wasn’t coming from a traditional media server, and navigating between servers was fairly painful. In fact, why should you need to think about servers at all when you should be able to just find the thing you want and play it? (It’s an important factor, of course, but it shouldn’t get in the way.)</p>
<p>As a way of taming the growing number of sources, some of which lived in the cloud, we devised a UI navigation scheme that we referred to internally as “type-first”. That is, you pick the type of media you’re looking for (“I’d like to watch a movie”), then pick from a (smaller) number of sources that contain that type of media. In the end, it was well-intentioned and it solved a few things nicely for many folks, but it also introduced a great deal of friction for some. Based on all the feedback (both internal and external), we went back to the drawing board in search of a better approach.</p>
<p>Internally, we refer to the new effort as “UNO”, since bringing a unified, consistent experience to all platforms and devices is one of the core objectives. A few others include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Restoring some basic usability qualities that suffered a bit under “type-first”. Fewer clicks to get where you want to go. More discoverable actions and sources. More intuitive gestures and navigation. Fewer distractions with things you shouldn’t have to care about.</li>
<li>Ownership and customization. You have complete control over your navigation—you tell Plex what you care about, we build an experience for you, and if you don’t like it, you can rearrange sources, hide sources, and more.</li>
<li>Improved functionality in a multi-source world. Features like Search need to work perfectly to deliver exactly the results you want.</li>
<li>At the core of the experience is the sidebar. In addition to being a better use of screen space than the top menu, it lets you see all the stuff you care about, and none of the stuff you don’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Well, it&#8217;s almost here again. That day when our nation&#8217;s finest technical minds are focused, laser-like, on fake product announcements and promo videos to match. It&#8217;s not as if we haven&#8217;t been guilty in the past. Some may remember <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/happy-april-fools-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Rickroll of 2013</a>. Clearly one of our finest moments.</p>
<p>But 2019 is all about empowering our loyal friends. Our tireless server admins. The ones who toil day after day on behalf of their own loving friends and family. Ask yourselves: isn&#8217;t it time you give the Gift of Rick?</p>
<p>Since we want folks to be able to get things set up and in place before the 1st, we are letting you know about this today. If you have an active Plex Pass subscription, all you need to do is grab the latest <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass Server beta release</a> and check the &#8220;April Fools 2019&#8221; setting under <em>Settings &gt; Extras</em> (if you already installed the beta release and don’t see the setting, try restarting your server) and we&#8217;ll take care of the rest. On April 1st your shared users will get a very special Rickroll before the first movie they play that day; it has an emoji heart and everything!<br />

I know it’s been a while since we’ve blogged, but on a more serious note (and not wanting to give too much away) April is going to be massive for us on several platforms. Stay tuned. There are seriously awesome things to come.</p>
<p>&#8230; and good luck getting that song out of your head! Rick and Roll!</p>
