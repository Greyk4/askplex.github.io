										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, we’ve reached the conclusion of our journey together with <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac Efron</a>. It’s sad to say goodbye, but as with every trip, there comes the period shortly thereafter where you complain to anyone in earshot about how horrible it was to travel with another person. </p>
<p>Maybe your companions slept too late or awoke too early. Maybe they committed a few too many faux pas while spending time in a foreign land. As for my experience with <em>Down to Earth with Zac Efron</em>, I honestly wish the show had been about our host traveling the globe to uncover the truth behind old urban legends that people only believed when they were teenagers. </p>
<p>You know. Stopping by the office of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/marilyn-manson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marilyn Manson’s</a> personal physician to discuss his rib situation. Asking an Appalachian fertility specialist if the Yellow No. 5 in Mountain Dew will really lower your sperm count. And, of course, traveling to Switzerland to learn about how the little metal flakes in Goldschlager make tiny cuts in your throat so that the alcohol can reach your blood faster. </p>
<p>These are the answers I seek. </p>
<p>Let’s head to London. </p>
<p><H3>Episode 7: London</H3></p>

<p>Our penultimate episode begins in London. A right proper Englishman who looks like the farmer from <em>Babe</em> warns Zac about the nearby piles of loose syringes. Zero context is provided in this cold open. </p>
<p>This tweedy scarecrow then informs Zac that he may become “unwell” if they happen to come into contact with any rat urine. Let me tell you, I used to work with rats daily. And I have only grown stronger through my exposure to their various fluids and secretions.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we are soon informed that Zac has volunteered to pick up trash and visit with some eco innovators in jolly old England. But of course, we must first visit the Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Someone has to pay for all the rat urine and philanthropy seen on the show. </p>
<p>In addition to raising Hilton’s brand awareness, we also learn that the hotel roof is host to a bee colony. Our apiarist informs us that misused pesticides and genetically modified crops pose a threat to bee populations. I hold my breath as I wait for someone to claim that scientists don’t understand how bees fly. No one does. It’s safe to come out. </p>
<p>Now that Hilton has gotten its money’s worth and notified any potential guests about the close proximity of bee colonies, it’s finally time to see how London deals with pollution. </p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17055 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dr-rode-and-vincent-gallo-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Meeting with economist and Vincent Gallo lookalike Dr. Phillip Rode, Zac and cohost Darin Olien learn that fine particulate matter is a danger to the city’s population. London has addressed automotive pollution by charging those with high-output automobiles higher fees to enter inner city streets, which decreased the number of automobiles by 20 percent. This all sounds very good. Now let’s visit a giant slide for no reason at all. </p>
<p>Zac and Darin soon arrive at the ArcelorMittal Orbit, which the Irish refer to as the Arse Orb. This is a massive, futuristic eyesore that doubles as an adult slide. Darin claims that this structure has an ultra-fast supersonic elevator, which sounds like a lie. Or at the very least, unnecessary.</p>
<p>Apparently this structure does feature the “tallest, longest tube slide in the world.” I guess something has to hold that distinction. It’s odd to consider that there is a “world’s largest” of every single thing in existence. That makes it seem like a much less significant accomplishment. I’ve made myself sad now.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17056 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/huge-slide-godzilla-vs-kaiju-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>After prominently using his Visa to purchase tickets, Zac and Darin strap on some Depression-era football helmets and take a trip down the slide. We learn nothing from this. Sometimes a slide is just a slide, except when it is a way to unconsciously relive your original trip down the birth canal.</p>

<p>Returning to where we started, with all the talk of syringes and rat urine, we meet the team of Thames 21. This volunteer group carries out cleanup projects along the Thames River. Or the River Thames. I never know which one. Those sneaky Brits. </p>
<p>One key problem highlighted here is that plastic is littered about everywhere, and it ultimately enters the food chain as it breaks down. Zac and Darin join the cleanup effort, and we get a heartfelt montage. This is capped off by Zac calling humans the sole enemy of the planet. That’s pretty hardcore, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac Efron</a>. Damn. Please recycle.</p>
<p>As highlighted in this show, the Earth’s only true heroes are the good folks at Hilton. They even go as far as lending Darin a bamboo bike to tool around on in London. Thanks Hilton. I look forward to resting under your thrumming apiaries and mounting your wooden bikes. </p>
<p>Curiously Darin, a vegan health expert, does not accompany Zac as he visits vegan food blogger and restaurateur Ella Mills. Ella began eating vegan when her previous diet led to a slew of health problems. She teaches Zac how to make a vegetable curry, but the show doesn’t have enough time to really walk you through the recipe so just figure it out for yourself.</p>
<p>Ella joins Darin and Zack for dinner at Aulis, a development kitchen for master chef Simon Rogan. After a lengthy breakdown of the chef’s approach to crafting a menu, Zac explains that “The concept is to let nature dictate what’s for dinner.” This is just cooking what’s in season. It’s an established concept. No need to run it through the test kitchen. </p>
<p>The meal crescendos into everyone moaning about how good mushrooms are, but here’s a joke I thought of during this scene:<br />
Q: Why are British graves so even?<br />
A: They’re all in the symmetry. </p>

<p>Real gold, that. Now on to the Amazon.</p>
<p><H3>Episode 8: Iquitos</H3></p>
<p>Zac opens this season’s final episode being positioned into some apparatus deep in the Amazon while downplaying the ills of cannibalism. Seriously. I couldn’t imagine a scenario in which <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac Efron</a> reveals himself as a cannibalism apologist while unidentified men cover him in a tarp, but here we are.</p>
<p>After an awkward pause — awkward because of all the unprovoked cannibal talk — Zac reveals that this episode isn’t about eating humans at all. Haha! What?! You raised and dashed our hopes most expertly, sir. </p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17059 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-and-leatherface-1-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Venturing deep into Peru, we meet an ecologist named Tarek who is a “good friend” of Darin’s. I’m noticing that all of Darin’s good friends live far away from him, deep in the jungle. “Here are my good friends Colonel Kurtz and Bruce Banner when he’s trying not to be the Hulk. Text me when you want to hang.”</p>
<p>Tarek sustainably harvests local fruits that may not be well known to a wider audience. As Zac wades through the knee-high water, his fears of leeches are confirmed. The guide casually says “Leeches are fine” which, probably not. Like, unless you are a medieval barber, you probably aren’t super lackadaisical on leeches.</p>
<p>Zac counters the guide’s comment with the witty rejoinder “Leeches suck.” This is actually a pretty funny thing to say. Yeah, it’s a bit obvious, but fairly witty coming from a man who is trying not to have his blood stolen by jungle creatures.</p>
<p>Throughout this hike through the dense jungle brush, Darin keeps impersonating <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/arnold-schwarzenegger" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, but he’s not even doing lines from <em>Predator</em>. Like, why are you like this Darin?</p>
<p>Thankfully Zac quotes <em>Jumanji</em> and the pressure on my brain begins to ease due to all the stupid relevance.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17061 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-jungle-pred-and-robin-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Zac and the gang march through the jungle, eating various tree bark scrapings and stems as Darin speaks about their medicinal value. As they harvest some resin from a tree, Zac replies that he never knows what to put on his lesions. </p>
<p>This begs the question: just how many <em>lesions </em>are you dealing with?</p>
<p>Then Zac spends almost two hours climbing a tree. If he didn’t have lesions before, he does now. Also, probably leeches. </p>
<p>Having scaled a tree, Zac visits a shaman to learn about ayahuasca. Zac claims that when used properly, the hallucinogen can allow users to experience memories from their past and have a true awakening. Instead of natural hallucinogens, I easily relive my past through constant waves of shame and embarrassment, which I have in limitless supply. Nothing says spiritual awakening like recalling every time you had an erection when the teacher called on you in middle school. Please awaken these moments for me while I’m deep in the jungle.</p>
<p>As one does, Zac and Darin agree to meet with a shaman and steam themselves above a mixture of various plants, some of which are promised to open the spirit. We don’t really get a good idea of the results of this experience as the scene just kind of peters out while Zac and Darin dry off. I don’t need to see a kaleidoscopic Willy Wonka riverboat montage, but maybe someone could look into the camera and describe what they just experienced. </p>
<p>Then things take a bad turn.</p>
<p>We learn that Darin’s home was destroyed in the California wildfires. This is horrible. We hear voicemails left by Darin’s mom and ex-wife, actress <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/eliza-coupe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eliza Coupe</a>. His house is completely gone. This is now a show about a man who has pretty much lost everything. But in that, they manage to find something that resonates with the series’ greater purpose. It’s a really incredible pivot.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17062 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zac-n-darin-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Despite losing his home, Darin wants to continue on with the show. So that’s what we do.</p>
<p>Darin explains that all he has now is his luggage. He manages to channel his emotions into a lengthy monologue explaining that the show is about how the planet is in danger and how that is changing our lives. And now it has quite literally hit home for him.</p>
<p>This is very well done. But thanks to the show’s rigid structure, now it’s time to go to a restaurant. To take Darin’s mind off his real life tragedy, Zac eats grubs.</p>
<p>Zac is great to have around when you’re feeling down. He really knows how to play the fool to hide a warrior’s pain. “It tastes like teriyaki,” he says, and there is much rejoicing.</p>

<p>En route to the airport to return home, Darin launches into one final profanity-laced monologue as Zac sits in the backseat of the car like “I feel you man.” Seriously. He says that. It&#8217;s a great end to a fantastic adventure. A sad car ride. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the episode ends with a final title card. It appears that the planet died shortly after production wrapped on the show. It was fatally stabbed by the Moon. The final episode of <em>Down to Earth with Zac Efron</em> is dedicated to Earth (incipit-2020). You will be missed. </p>

<p>The most surprising thing about <em>Down to Earth with Zac Efron</em> is that, on occasion, a deeply personal story briefly peeks through the seams of the Netflix travelogue. </p>
<p>These fleeting moments come when <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Efron</a> is shown in the middle of a long car ride, staring out of the window, his eyes to the horizon. Then in the midst of all the talk about volcanic energy and sustainable farming, he’ll reveal the insecurities that surround his notoriety. It really does appear that Efron sees the absurdity in using his own fame to lend notoriety to the doctors and researchers highlighted on the show. </p>
<p>In some ways, Efron is like the Thing from the Fantastic Four. He may not like what the world sees when it looks at him, but he will use his horrible new powers to save the world. Or I’ve watched six episodes of this show and Stockholm syndrome has started to set in. We’ll see. </p>
<h3>Episode 5: Lima</h3>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16979 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zac-apple-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>The Lima episode begins, naturally, in New York, which you may know as “the Lima of the U.S.” You know this episode is going to be a mess because while stuck in traffic, cohost Darin Olien looks over to Zac and says, “Apples have a very interesting history.” </p>
<p>While most likely a true statement, knowing Darin, he will quickly find a way to prove himself wrong. He begins his tale by saying that apples are originally from Kazakhstan and that’s pretty much the only takeaway. Conversation tip No. 1: Clearly distinguish your “cool stories” from your “fun facts.”</p>
<p>Arriving at an orchard in the Upstate, Zac explains the pressure of always having to be camera ready under the constant gaze of the paparazzi. He recalls his first appearances on the cover of <em>Tiger Beat</em>. You know, standard orchard talk.</p>
<p>We then get some insight into the pathos that led to Efron making this show. And honestly, it’s the best, most honest thing I’ve seen in the past five episodes. </p>
<p>“Success without purpose is a pretty meaningless life,” Zac says, as he examines his place in the world. I wish the show would focus more on that. But instead we’ve got to hear more about apple varieties like we’re caught in some harvest festival purgatory. </p>
<p>At Angry Orchards, Zac meets head cider maker Ryan Burke. Ryan quickly runs down all the dos and don’ts of the orchard grounds. What’s allowed and what’s not. These are commonly known as the cider house rules.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16985 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cider-house-efron-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Ryan explains that before Prohibition, most Americans consumed apples in the form of cider, because life at the time was terrible. Wrapping up this scene, Ryan also confirms Darin’s claim about apples originating in Kazakhstan. With that said, we venture to Kazakhstan, home of the world’s largest variety of wild sheep and… </p>
<p>Oh. Wait. </p>
<p>We’re going to Lima. Not sure what all that Kazakhstan talk was about. On to Peru. </p>
<p>Arriving in Lima, Zac and Darin visit the International Potato Center, which houses more varieties of potato strains than anywhere else in the world. Serving as one of the world’s doomsday vaults, the center will preserve the potato in the event of an environmental catastrophe, while also working to engineer new varieties that can resist the effects of climate change. Other doomsday vaults include Norway’s Svalbard Global Seed Vault, Taiwan’s World Vegetable Center, and America’s International House of Pancakes. </p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17018 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ihop-seedyAF-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>We then meet Rainer, the cryoengineering specialist who escorts Zac and Darin to the gene bank. The best part of this is Rainer typing in what seems to be a 30-digit passcode at the entrance. This scene goes on so long that it feels like an <em>Austin Powers</em> bit. It’s incredible. </p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17014 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rainer-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Rainer looks like Justin Vernon from Bon Iver had a baby with the brothers from Arcade Fire. Even better, he sounds like <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/werner-herzog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Werner Herzog</a>. But instead of describing the horrific absurdities of the human condition in the face of nature, he is talking about preserving potatoes in the event of a nuclear war and global warming. </p>
<p>So yes, exactly like Werner Herzog. Let’s hope this episode slowly veers into <em>Fitzcarraldo</em> territory with Rainer at the helm. </p>
<p>Zac then explains the chemical properties of liquid nitrogen before dunking a GoPro in a freezing chemical bath. He really contains multitudes.</p>
<p>Having unsuccessfully attempted to ruin more camera equipment, Zac meets Virgilio Martinez, a Peruvian skateboarder turned master chef. Virgilio then abducts the camera crew at machete-point, and he and Rainer film themselves absconding with the world’s supply of super potatoes. Not really, but damn would you love to see it. </p>
<p>Instead, we get the usual. Martinez sources hyperlocal foods for his restaurants. Zac and Darin consume several courses of cuisine that I don’t recognize at all. Martinez then grabs Zac, and they go skateboarding. Again, multitudes.</p>
<p>While it would be cool to see a compilation of CKY-style shred sessions between Zac and Martinez, we instead jump to Darin’s all-vegan birthday dinner, which is exactly as fun as it sounds.</p>
<p>In lieu of a cake, they shove a candle into a large bean or seed of some sort. Oh, but it’s a trick candle that never goes out. A true Peruvian classic.</p>
<p>Starting a new day, we find Darin and Zac practicing breathing techniques on the rooftop of a Hilton hotel. Magically they manage to find relaxation atop an actual monument to luxury. Remember this part for next episode. </p>
<p>Zac and Darin then travel to the nearby dunes to go sandboarding, which is how the CIA tortures Anakin Skywalker.</p>

<p>In a final summation, Zac opines that it may not be nuclear war or “apes taking over the planet” that doom humanity. Instead it could be dramatic food shortages.</p>
<p>Oh, and the episode ends with an in memoriam to a crew member’s dog. This is all getting very grim. I am sorry. This is not what people need right now. Hopefully things will pick up. </p>
<p>Where are we headed next? </p>
<p>Post Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico. </p>
<p>Hrmmmmm.</p>

<h3>Episode 6: Puerto Rico</h3>
<p>Arriving at the port of San Juan, Darin and Zac immediately split up. Darin forks off in search of local food sources while Zac meets up with San Juan Mayor Carmen Cruz. </p>
<p>Zac describes Mayor Cruz as a “polarizing” figure. I guess she is “polarizing” if you consider “not wanting all your constituents to perish” as a political side, but here we are. </p>
<p>At the time of production, Zac says it’s been one year since hurricanes devastated the island. Standing inside a stadium that housed hundreds or thousands of displaced locals in the aftermath of the storms, Zac is humbled when the mayor asks him to sign the “Wall of Hope” alongside major celebrities and community leaders who directly contributed to the recovery effort. At first, Zac is reluctant, as he hasn’t been rescuing people from floodwaters and has just now made his way to Puerto Rico. The mayor says it’s important that Efron is keeping the word out about climate change and the ongoing recovery need in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>As Zac joins the mayor to visit members of the community most affected by the destruction, we reach the most resonant scenes of the show so far. A local family still has a yard full of debris. They are unable to remove it. Zac offers to go grab Darin, and then the crew will clear everything out of the way. The best part of this is that it’s simple. Not everything has to be a grand gesture. Sometimes people just need you to help them load up a truck. </p>
<p>This act of goodwill is shown in a nice efficient montage, which is really heartwarming until the director or someone decides to strap a GoPro on an actual piece of these people’s destroyed home to follow its sick journey to the truck. </p>
<p>Just don’t. We don’t need “rad” natural disaster cleanup footage. </p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16982 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rebuild-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Moving on, Zac and Darin visit a 50-farm cooperative so that Zac can milk a goat. The goat’s name is Chimby. In a scene that is definitely somebody’s fetish, Darin decides to linger over Zac’s shoulder while he’s mid-teat and repeats the phrase “drink the milk.”</p>
<p>Apparently goat milk is safe to drink straight from the udder. So Zac gulps down some warm goat milk. Describing the taste like a well-traveled goat sommelier, Zac says, “The nose of it is goat.” Awesome.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, but not coincidentally at all, Zac and Darin then visit a local Hilton hotel badly damaged in the storm. While I’m sure this is relevant to the story of how Puerto Rico continues working to recover from Hurricane Maria, the repeated appearance of Hilton properties feels like it’s more than just Efron’s brand loyalty. This becomes especially apparent when we are informed that the hotel “is gonna be beautiful” when repairs are completed. </p>
<p>Skipping ahead, Zac learns about a conservation organization grappling with the partial destruction of Puerto Rico’s local fishing industry. In addition to cleaning up debris and supplying local fishers, the group helped develop an app that connects anglers with restaurants. Efron describes this as “Tinder for fish.” </p>
<p>From a comedy writing perspective, this should cause your eyelid to twitch. Clearly, the appropriate nautical dating app joke is “This app is like Plenty of Fish (beat) for fish.” </p>
<p>I would have also taken “Forget Tinder. This is Fin-der,” but even that is pushing it. </p>
<p>We are treated to a series of scenes showing a few fresh catches make their way from the boat to a local chef’s kitchen. There, Zac enjoys a nice ceviche. The meal is capped off with a really unnatural shot that reaffirms my fears of awkward product placement. </p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16983 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/visa-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>From above, we see a check holder emblazoned with a large Visa logo sliding into view. Immediately, someone off camera plunks down a shiny Visa card and slides the check forward. It hasn’t been too bad up to this point, but the product placement in this episode has become a bit distracting. It’s one thing to see Zac wearing multiple pieces of clothing with the same brand names stitched across the front like he’s a Nascar driver, but now we’re getting out of hand. </p>
<p>Thankfully, Zac and Darin are rejoined by Mayor Cruz, who brings along her own swag in the form of powder blue baseball caps with the city’s ungainly municipal logo stitched on it. Now they all look like they are on the same embarrassing family vacation. </p>
<p>Mayor Cruz informs us that we are traveling deep into the jungle to meet a 10-year-old genius named Jose. Jose’s family is being presented with a brand-new prefabricated house designed to resist hurricane-force winds. </p>
<p>In a truly devastating story, almost all of Jose’s books were destroyed in the most recent storm. As they tour the new home, Darin advises Jose to drink plenty of water, which will allow him to retain more information. As always, Darin is a real fount of knowledge. Maybe hydration isn’t really the issue here. Perhaps there are some lingering systemic issues that are at play, Darin. </p>
<p>I’m just happy they didn’t make Jose do any “genius tricks,” like conduct long-division in his head or count a bunch of matches they tossed on the floor. </p>
<p>With that said, Jose and his family have a new house. Potatoes are somewhat safe. And Zac Efron is undergoing an existential crisis. I can’t wait to wrap things up with the final two episodes of <em>Down to Earth</em>, which will likely involve Zac going full Colonel Kurtz and self-isolating at a converted co-op in Silver Lake where aspiring child stars serve as his foot soldiers. </p>
<p>Join me for our thrilling conclusion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Man, listen. I am two things, okay? Two things. I’m a socialist, and I’m a rock ‘n’ roll believer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slurred words that came forth out of the dark on a muddy field a stone&#8217;s throw from East Midlands airport sometime in the early 2010s. I don’t remember saying them, but the recipient of that micro-manifesto has recounted the story to me enough times that I feel as if I do.</p>
<p>I’ve put out more than my fair share of hobgoblin gibberish in my time. As someone who spent a significant portion of his twenties in an interminable stream of blurry nights playing electric guitar for a pitiful wage in the various dives around Camden&#8211;a mystical centre for London&#8217;s dive bars&#8211;the frequency of actually lucid or accurate stuff is pitiful. But that proclamation is something I stand by. A socialist and a rock ‘n’ roll believer. It feels good to say it, to think it. Something solid and simple upon which to build everything else. Obviously, no human being can really be reduced to just two concepts. We’re a filthy mass of rainbow contradictions and endless complexity.</p>
<p>But still. A socialist and a rock ‘n’ roll believer. It just <em>feels good</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in my more introspective moments, I like to think how I became those things. The genesis of the former is easy to pinpoint. One need only glance at the state of the world briefly while growing up and boom: A socialist is born, baptized in the fire of a world turning to ashes of inequity.</p>
<p>The origins of the latter are less clear.</p>
<p>How did I become a rock ‘n’ roll believer? And not just a believer, but a full-on metalhead?</p>
<p>It’s a silly, trivial question that’s nevertheless occupied far too much of my time. I can’t help it. It brings me an inordinate amount of some kind of pleasure to dissect these things, especially as I get older (and it’s here I should admit that I’m all of 32 years of age, lest it sounds like I’m trying to make it appear as if I’m perched on the top of a hill in Shelbyville about to suggest a cool glass of turnip juice) and more and more psychologically involved with the ruined state of the world of the late Anthropocene.</p>
<p>I love love love rock and metal. For me, in terms of the most reliable sources of joy in this life it’s right up there with books, a barefoot morning walk through country grass, and a good Czech beer.</p>
<p>But how did I get there? What was the one moment that kicked it all off? And why does that somewhat self-indulgent examination release the tasty, tasty brain juices that it does?</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s just the bittersweet kick of nostalgia that always accompanies any such thought that looks back to our formative years. Just thinking the words, &#8220;How did I become a rock ‘n’ roll believer?&#8221; instantly conjures up images of hazy, golden afternoons and long dark nights filled with CDs and headphones and a sacred communion between a teenager and the holy texts passed down by a generation of (unfortunately mostly white male—one of the great sad indictments of the structural inequities of mid-to-late-twentieth century rock and metal) musicians.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, whenever I sit down and start listing off the possible moments that might’ve kicked off the passion that brings so much joy into my life, I get high. It’s a carousel of sensorial memory, rich in these singular moments that we realize only much later are limited in number but form the foundation of our lives. For me, I look at each one and think: &#8220;Is this the moment when I started to believe?&#8221;</p>

<p>Was it the first few seconds of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/jimi-hendrix" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hendrix</a>’s cover of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/bob-dylan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dylan</a>’s &#8220;All Along the Watchtower,&#8221; when those striking chords combined with haunting hits of percussion and bass instantly transport you to a windswept field full of foreboding, the perfect complement to Dylan’s lyrics?</p>

<p>Was it the point when Deep Purple’s Ritchie Blackmore hits that euphoric, sky-scraping note at the end of the opening run of the &#8220;Child in Time&#8221; solo at 3:34—opening up your mind completely to possibilities you could’ve never previously imagined—before warping you face-first into hyperspace when the transition comes at 4 minutes in.</p>
<p>Or was it something as simple as the tolling of a colossal bell, its four deep, ominous rings in the darkness heralding the coming of something unknown and malevolent?</p>
<p>That last moment is the one I keep coming back to more and more as time goes on, and it’s the moment that hangs like a shadow over the <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/maureen-goldthorpe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maureen Goldthorpe</a>-directed documentary about the band responsible for that ominous bell. As it winds its way to that fateful point in their story, 2012’s <em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/movie/dirty-deeds-the-story-of-acdc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dirty Deeds: The Story of AC/DC</a></em> remains in many ways similar to the band itself: It’s lean, mean, and it comes in and gets the job done without too much faffing about.</p>
<p>Telling the story of one of the biggest rock bands of all time in just over an hour might seem like it’s doing the band a disservice, but <em>Dirty Deeds</em> intentionally doesn’t go in for the deep dive. Lest that sounds like I’m being harsh on it I should set the record straight that that isn’t the case.</p>
<p>Through a collection of:</p>
<ul>
<li>archival footage</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>gigs and interviews with key band members</li>
</ul>

<p>—<em>Dirty Deeds</em> paints a satisfying portrait of this famously un-fussy, stripped back musical juggernaut.</p>

<p>Indeed AC/DC have long been such a totemic, megalithic presence in the annals of popular music that it’s sometimes hard to think of them as human creations at all.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think they simply <em>are, and always have been and will be.</em> That mammoth slabs of rock like &#8220;TNT&#8221; and &#8220;Highway to Hell&#8221; and &#8220;Back in Black&#8221; would always have been written, and if AC/DC hadn’t done it, someone else surely would have.</p>
<p>But no-one else did.</p>
<p>AC/DC did.</p>

<p>Guitarists Angus and Malcolm Young—two kids from a Scottish working-class family who migrated to Australia in the mid-60s in search of a better life, carved those tunes out of the marble of the mountain.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Theirs was not destiny set in stone, but one hewn out of the featureless rock by sheer force of will.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/movie/dirty-deeds-the-story-of-acdc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dirty Deeds: The Story of AC/DC</a></em> does a great job of showing this, highlighting not just how hard Angus and Malcolm worked, but of the support they received from their strong, loyal family (their older brother George Young, who produced much of their earliest work being a key figure), and of the infamous tragedy that befell the band just as it was about to go stratospheric.</p>

<p>The death of vocalist Bon Scott after the 1979 release of the band’s iconic <em>Highway to Hell</em> album really is one of the most poetically tragic in a genre filled with such incidents. Here was the band—having worked tirelessly for the best part of a decade, touring endlessly and writing and recording like a pack of bloodhounds on a scent—now on the cusp of finally breaking America and receiving that worldwide stardom they had been flirting with for some time, when their singer and friend was suddenly found lifeless in a car in London. The story had always resonated with me as Bon&#8217;s last night was spent at a club in the very same Camden that I roam to this day. The place might have changed since then, but the echoes of the past sound to this day.</p>
<p>Bon Scott had been central to the band’s success. Malcolm and Angus had provided the foundations, and new (soon-to-be superstar) producer Robert &#8220;Mutt&#8221; Lange had brought with him a weapons-grade level of polish to <em>Highway to Hell</em>—but without Scott and his inimitable rock star charm, ocean-sized levels of charisma, and cheeky street poet lyricism, AC/DC would not have achieved their ascent into orbit. If the band had decided to pack it in and call it a day after his tragic death, no one could have blamed them.</p>

<p>They, of course, did the exact opposite.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>They marched right back into that studio with new singer <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/brian-johnson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brian Johnson</a> and they recorded the second best-selling album of all time.</h3>

<p>1980’s <em>Back in Black</em> was intended as a tribute of sorts to their departed friend, and its spirit of defiance, its testament to the raw power of rock as a means of ploughing through adversity with a neck made of steel through incessant headbanging, has gotten me through many a tough time too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back in Black,&#8221; &#8220;You Shook Me All Night Long,&#8221; &#8220;Shoot to Thrill&#8221;—the album, 40 years old now, is casually peppered with some of the best rock songs ever written.</p>
<p>And then there is &#8220;Hells Bells.&#8221; One of the greatest album-opening songs ever made, and a tune I keep coming back to over the years as a very strong contender for the spark that lit the fuse that dynamited my brain and made sure that for the rest of my life I would crave distorted guitar, thunderous drums, and ear-splitting vocals.</p>
<div class="responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etAIpkdhU9Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>I still remember picking the album up for the first time. I was in my mid-teens, and had been a passive absorber of music at best up until then. I’d listen to whatever was on the radio, and whatever people around me were into, but I’d do it without much engagement.</p>
<p>I’d begun to feel the stirrings of something that would later become an all-consuming passion, but my flirtation with rock had been minimal at that point. Then one day I was idly browsing a record shop (remember those) when a matte black slab of a CD (remember those) caught my eye.</p>
<p>It seemed to have no graphic or logo or band name or anything on the front. It was just a jet black portal to another dimension. I was instantly hypnotized and drawn towards it. Picking it up I realized there was something there. Embossed in a raised font there were shapes in the black. I raised the package up and turned it until the light brought relief: &#8220;AC/DC.&#8221; &#8220;Back in Black.&#8221;</p>
<p>I must’ve zoned out into a fugue state there and then because the next thing I remember is being sat at home on my bed, headphones firmly on, with the &#8220;Back in Black&#8221; case in my lap, lyrics booklet in hand, and CD beginning to spin in my stereo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gong!&#8221; went the bell in the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gong!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gong!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gong!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then the most seductive, malevolent riff I’d ever heard crept out of the shadows and opened the floodgates of my brain. A bass and drums soon joined in, locking into a beat that commanded my head to bang from then until eternity.</p>
<p>And then that voice. Like an apocalyptic banshee riding the gale winds that bring total ruination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a rolling thunder, a pouring rain. I&#8217;m comin&#8217; on like a hurricane. My lightning&#8217;s flashing across the sky. You&#8217;re only young but you&#8217;re gonna die.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was it. I knew even then, there was no going back from this.</p>
<p>Half my current lifetime later, I am unable to hear that gong toll without instantly feeling that which has become so rare now in later years: What it was like to really discover something, to grapple with an entity completely new and unknown, on the cusp of a yawning chasm that has suddenly opened up beneath your feet, the breeze blowing and tugging at you.</p>
<p>And the thrill of knowing you&#8217;ll jump.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I write this, a minor debate has broken out on the Internet regarding <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac Efron</a>’s physique on Netflix’s <em>Down to Earth</em>. Appearing on the show as something other than a hairless marble statue given life, Efron was described as having a “dad bod” by some. This is, of course, absurd. But it also showcases how skewed our standards for television are currently. Let me explain.</p>
<p>When assessing Efron as he appears on <em>Down to Earth</em>, some feel the urge to compare him to the impossible and very much dehydrated level of hench that he achieved for films such as <em>Baywatch</em> and <em>Neighbors</em>. But here’s the thing, those are major studio films. <em>Down to Earth</em>, despite being a Netflix original, is just TV. And that’s fine.</p>
<p>The problem is that our standards have been spoiled a bit by having lived through the recent era of Peak TV. Shows like <em>The Sopranos</em>, <em>Breaking Bad</em>, <em>Mad Men</em>, and <em>Game of Thrones</em> achieved a level of cinematic artistry that was once only reserved for film. This collided with the rise of streaming services, and now you can watch anything and everything at a whim. This has led to many people conflating TV with major films, and in the case of Efron, film bodies with TV bodies.</p>
<p>Remember: Every TV show used to just be two people talking in a kitchen, and then a third person shows up. That was it. So let’s maybe forgive Zac for passing on complete body waxes and four-a-days while he travels the world to learn about vegan tattoos and how we are destroying the planet.</p>
<h3>Episode 3: Costa Rica</h3>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16897 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-efron-bus-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Introducing us to what he describes as an “affordable” and tropically beautiful Central American country, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac</a> explains that he had a big budget for this episode. So naturally, he rented a massive bus to drive around town.</p>
<p>And this isn’t a case where he says, “This thing runs on old French fry grease” or anything. This is just a monstrous gas-guzzler that he has paid to transport him deep into the heart of a remote eco-village. The next step up from this is strapping a bunch of jet engines to that trash island in the middle of the ocean and driving it to your upcoming beach sweep.</p>
<p>Co-host Darin Olien, a man who seems to have lived his entire life in a refrigerator box, describes the sustainable community they visit as a “food forest place” and asks Zac, “What if your lawn was food?”<br />
That’s a farm, Darin. Also, gardens. These are things that exist. No need to imagine.</p>
<p>We then meet Darin’s friend, Stephen, who is co-creator of this “food forest place,” La Ecovilla. Stephen explains that this community was founded because many people live in cities and suburbs and their food is shipped in. He dreamed of a society living amongst its food, which again is a farm. Like they have in rural areas.</p>
<p>Also, climates vary and not every area can support a subsistent agricultural industry, but it’s fine. Stephen seems like a nice guy with his heart in the right place. Let’s just hope he’s not about to introduce us to a charismatic leader who always wears sunglasses and keeps marrying everyone in the village.</p>
<p>After Stephen criticizes people who love chocolate, but have not sampled pure cacao fresh from the source, we arrive at his massive “hand-sculpted” estate. And I don’t use the term “estate” lightly. This place is palatial. Maybe let’s not chocolate-shame people who just want to enjoy a Snickers from time to time in their studio apartment.</p>

<p><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac</a> says the goal of La Ecovilla is to create the smallest environmental footprint. This philosophy ties into how the community handles its waste. Describing waste management, Stephen says, “The problem is the solution,” which is one of those things we say that don’t mean anything.</p>
<p>La Ecovilla utilizes a methane digester that repurposes human waste as fertilizer. Unable to simply describe it as “solids,” Zac adds that he really means “poops.” Also, Darin labels the balloons that collect methane gas and prevent it from entering the atmosphere as “the community fart bag.” This is why we can’t have nice things.</p>

<p>Next we visit the village school. There are no divisions amongst grades as students from ages 3-18 are all taught together. The school director is oddly proud of how all the students have ready access to kitchen knives that they use to prepare lunch.</p>
<p>I used to work at a tutoring center, and I would let the kids go to the 7-Eleven a few doors down. I didn’t really celebrate their ability to return unharmed as a sign of a successful learning environment, but the role of an educator is hard to define.</p>
<p>As a child speeds by on a zipline, the school director says there are no tests or homework. Zac responds to this by miming that his mind has exploded. I like the idea that even as a 30-something man, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac Efron</a> is still worried about getting homework. You must remember that he went to one of those high schools where they perform elaborately choreographed dance numbers and rap about basketball and how your dad won’t let you join glee club.</p>
<p>The next day finds Zac and Darin driving across the country in their big bus that defeats the purpose of the environmental village they just left. The boys arrive at a massive zipline operation, because that is apparently the most common form of transportation in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Darin, a man who manages to reduce the significance of every passing moment, describes the zipline harness as “a nut-cruncher” before an irritated park worker hurls him into the woods. After careening from tree line to tree line for no apparent reason, Zac and Darin visit the Jaguar Rescue Center.</p>
<p>The best part of this is that we learn that Zac’s favorite animal is the ocelot. No explanation for his preference is given, but it’s nice to gain more insight into his mind.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16902 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-ocelot-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Encar, the founder of the center, explains that the rescue operation was founded when she and her husband met in Costa Rica and fell in love over their shared passion for nature and desire to save animals. That is a much more noble story than my wife and I have, as we both simply hated all the same things about the people we know.</p>
<p>Encar then reveals that her husband died a few years ago after they founded the rescue center. Please consider for a moment that there is a movie called <em>We Bought a Zoo</em> that isn’t about these people.</p>
<p>Encar then shows off a rare endangered armadillo. I’m very familiar with armadillos. The stretch of Georgia where I grew up is populated with a variety of armadillo that carries leprosy, so if you ever want to catch a disease made famous by the Bible, please consider a visit to middle Georgia.<br />
We then catch back up with La Ecovilla’s Stephen, who says he decided to improve conditions in Costa Rica when he vacationed there with his parents and witnessed some locals on a banana plantation get crop dusted.<br />
Again, Stephen seems to be trying to do something positive, but maybe we could hear from some actual locals. Like, some people who grew up in the area. The show awkwardly cuts to some actual Costa Ricans silently piloting Stephen’s boat while he recites lines from the white savior playbook, and it’s just a bit of a groaner.</p>
<p>Up to this point, <em>Down to Earth</em> has been a bit scattershot in terms of the show’s ultimate intentions. Honestly, I think it’s time for a fresh start. And where best to start over than in one of the most elderly communities on Earth.</p>
<h3>Episode 4: Sardinia</h3>
<p>Reaching the halfway point of this season, we find a contemplative <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac Efron</a> informing his co-host that he is done with Hollywood. Zac says it’s just not an environment conducive to a long, happy life. I don’t know what it is about Sardinia that has brought on this sudden realization, but Zac’s been on screen since he was a kid. He should do whatever is necessary to take care of himself. Leave Hollywood if that’s what you need, Zac. Start over. Move to Sardinia, buy a goat, and grow artichokes. Just don’t fall prey to the system.</p>
<p>Oh wait. Apparently, that eye-opening moment of clarity was just a big goof, as Zac tells us in voiceover that he’s not leaving the limelight. You got us, I guess.</p>
<p>In this episode, Zac visits Sardinia to learn the secret to living a long, healthy life. It makes sense that Efron is concerned about aging because as we learned in <em>17 Again,</em> at some point he becomes a sad <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/matthew-perry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matthew Perry</a>. </p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-parry-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16903 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-parry-side-by-side.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-parry-side-by-side-300x222.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-parry-side-by-side-768x569.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-parry-side-by-side-800x593.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-parry-side-by-side-640x474.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-parry-side-by-side-400x296.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-parry-side-by-side-150x111.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Apparently, Sardinia boasts one of the world’s longest average lifespans. Zac and Darin meet with two researchers studying the area’s elderly population. One common trend that these researchers have found among the region’s older residents is a low protein diet, which they say reduces the chances for age-related diseases.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this contradicts what I learned from the 1960 film <em>The Leech Woman</em>, which taught me that the secret to eternal youth was harvesting secretions from the pineal glands of unsuspecting men. If anything, <em>Down to Earth</em> has saved the lives of countless men with engorged pineal glands.</p>
<p>Zac tags along as the researchers visit a local woman born in 1920. They applaud as she successfully draws a clock during a cognitive test (just like the president!). Put her on the ballot.</p>
<p>Watching Zac assess his own aging is all the more poignant in light of the whole “dad bod” fiasco I mentioned earlier. It’s one thing to get older. It’s another to do it with the world watching, so I appreciate Efron’s candor.</p>
<p>Zac and his team spend a fair bit of this episode discussing disease-free living in a cemetery. Again, this is a moment that hits differently under the current pandemic.</p>
<p>As I write this, red lights bounce across my apartment. Two ambulances are parked in front of the building next door. The same address where two other ambulances were parked the night before.</p>
<p>There’s just something surreal about seeing <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac Efron</a> hanging out with centenarians sans a hazmat suit, but I guess this is the new normal.</p>
<p>Moving on, we find Zac and Darin taking part in a Sardinian cooking class, followed by a delightful homemade dinner. Tucking into a plate of ravioli, Zac explains why he’s so happy to eat a carb. During the filming of <em>Baywatch</em>, he didn’t have a carb for six months. Six months! This is too great of a sacrifice for your art.</p>
<p>Zac then visits Francesco, a 97-year-old former World War 2 pilot turned shepherd and No. 1 fan of Zac’s beard. Francesco is great. He looks like a dried apple carving of the coolest person you can imagine. After meeting Zac, he puts on the suit that Valentino was buried in and they take a walk.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16904 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/francesco-dapper-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>We see how Francesco gets his steps in as they arrive at the bar he visits every day for some wine. Awesome. I always love when news stories about a 98-year-old who drinks Kentucky Gentleman every day go viral because it’s just younger people finding an excuse for their vices. Every time you see one of those articles pass across your feed, the sales of canned wine double.</p>
<p>The main takeaway from this episode and really the whole dad bod discussion is that I want <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac Efron</a> to live a long, healthy life, full of carbs. I want him to carve out a giant baguette and sail the seas of Sardinia with a celery paddle.</p>
<p>So we’re halfway through this season of <em>Down to Earth</em> and coming off its best episode yet. In the next episode, we’ll follow Zac to Lima and Puerto Rico, and hopefully uncover some more pearls of wisdom from our elders. As always, remember that Oprah said it best when she shouted “Bread!” in all those commercials. See you next time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, watching Netflix’s <em>Down to Earth with Zac Efron</em> is like that moment in a post-apocalyptic movie when the survivors find the last can of Coke or wistfully listen to an old pop standard on a wobbly gramophone. There’s just something about seeing an exuberant <em>Baywatch</em> star trotting the globe to try stone massages that feels like a relic from a forgotten past. A time when we could travel from country to country, greeting new faces with our only concerns being the betterment of a shared future. It’s clear from the show’s focus on clean living and environmentalism that Efron’s intentions are good. I guess the true irony is that the world he’s trying to save no longer resembles our own.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16767 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-darin-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<h3>Episode 1: Iceland</h3>
<p>Our premiere episode of <em>Down to Earth</em> finds <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Efron</a> focusing his attention on the Nordic island of Iceland. We are soon introduced to his sidekick and defacto co-host, Darin Olien. Darin looks like <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/scott-bakula" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scott Bakula</a> from <em>Quantum Leap</em>, but instead of “striving to put right what once went wrong and hoping each time that his next leap will be the leap home,” he is heckling Zac Efron about his facial hair.</p>

<p>As a bit of background on Darin, he is described as a health guru and is probably 10-15 years older than Zac. Despite his “Dad’s friend at the cookout” energy, I assume that Darin will serve as the bookish, grounded foil to Zac’s enthusiastic optimism.</p>
<p>That is not the case.</p>
<p>Greeting a real knit sweater of a man who goes by Siggy, our hosts learn that the surrounding villages are powered solely by renewable energy from waterfalls and volcanoes. Naturally, this point is highlighted by having Zac prepare rye bread and boiled eggs in a nearby hot spring.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16769 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-bread-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>It soon becomes apparent that Zac and Darin don’t have much on-screen chemistry. They just exchange a volley of “Wows” and “Yeps” while Siggy pulls more breakfast foods from the soil.</p>
<p>Siggy explains that his village heats their sidewalks throughout the winter to avoid having to shovel snow. This is an incredible flex from a man who perfectly personifies the Danish concept of <em>hygge</em>.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hygge-def.png" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16770 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hygge-def.png 1300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hygge-def-300x133.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hygge-def-1024x454.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hygge-def-768x340.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hygge-def-800x354.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hygge-def-640x284.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hygge-def-400x177.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hygge-def-150x66.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>Moving on, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac</a> and Darin then make their way to one of four geothermal plants in Iceland, which Zac describes as “sick.” He is majorly stoked.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16791 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sick-zac-1-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Explaining how the plant accesses thermal energy deep beneath the planet’s surface, Zac describes the “bore holes” drilled through the earth’s crust. In lieu of any actual humor thus far in the episode, Zac repeating the term “bore holes” is sort of a comedic oasis.</p>
<p>Despite the explanation of how this incredible facility creates clean, renewable energy, the most compelling revelation in this scene is that Zac’s dad works at a nuclear power plant. While this is unexpected on my end, I’m sure Father Efron’s coworkers at the plant are likewise surprised to hear that his son will be portraying <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/movie/the-stranger-beside-me" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ted Bundy</a> and Fred from <em>Scooby Doo</em> in nearly back-to-back roles.</p>
<p>In a brief confounding moment, Zac notices a small display case in the powerplant hallway containing an ornamental samurai helmet. “Sweet,” he says in voice over. “I wonder why that’s there?”</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16771 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-samuri-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><em>Good question.</em> That’s a very good question that probably has an equally interesting answer for viewers of your show. You’ve really teed this one up! Time to knock it out of the park!</p>
<p>“I guess I’ll never know,” Zac says as the scene ends.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><em>Ask!</em> It’s <em>your </em>show.</p>
<p>You traveled all the way to Iceland and ate eggs from the boiling earth. No need to be bashful now. Strap on your captain’s hat and take the helm of your own show.</p>
<p>What this scene indicates is that the show’s producers thought that the samurai display was <em>so interesting</em> that it couldn’t hit the cutting room floor, but found no way to work around the fact that no one asked why the hell it was there. Incredible.</p>
<p>It’s clear that the aim of this show is somewhat altruistic as <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac</a> repeatedly pleads with his audience to consider the dire need to adapt our lifestyles and adopt more ecologically sound practices on a global level.</p>
<p>The only problem is scenes such as these are intercut with Zac and Darin going to a Viking spa or an artisanal chocolate shop. This somewhat undermines the dire realization that we are killing the planet, but I guess chocolate and massages are useful for relieving the tension one feels when they realize the end times are near. Plus: no one in their right mind would ever begrudge a celebrity from getting free travel, lodging, and artisanal cuisine if they remind us from time to time about ice caps and various other existential minutiae.</p>
<p>During their visit to the chocolatier, Zac manages to make about five Willy Wonka references in a row before being given the opportunity to craft his own bar. He decides to take the aggressive approach and use every available topping like it’s last call at a nacho bar.</p>
<p>After ruining a substantial amount of fine chocolates, Zac and Darin visit one of Iceland’s most popular natural wonders. They are immediately met by a local park worker, who does his best to prevent everyone from stepping off the side of a cliff. The show then goes out of its way to humiliate this park employee after he fails to answer the hosts’ questions.</p>

<p>Footage of this unnamed park ranger saying he doesn’t know how many people visit this waterfall each year are overlaid with voiceover of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac</a> saying “Uhhhh, OK.” Maybe the dude’s job is simply preventing onlookers from tumbling into the violent tides below. Let’s do our best to not harass the locals on a global streaming platform, guys.</p>
<p>Our next stop finds Zac and Darin visiting a hydroelectric plant to learn more about how force generates power. They likely took this information back to the waterfall to continue demeaning that park ranger.<br />
While surveilling the caverns that sit under the plant, Zac compares it to “<a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/val-kilmer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Val Kilmer’s</a> bat cave.” So let’s stop here. He didn’t say Batman’s bat cave or simply the Bat Cave. No, Zac named a specific actor who portrayed Batman, but he went with Kilmer!?</p>
<p>Now, I loved <em>Batman Forever</em> and appreciate the work of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/val-kilmer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Val Kilmer</a>, but this is like if someone said, “Wow, this is like <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/brandon-routh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brandon Routh’s</a> Fortress of Solitude.” It’s just an odd connection to make.</p>
<p>Having broken my mind, Zac and Darin then visit one of Iceland’s finest restaurants, where I am sure they are being pranked. First, the chef serves a plate of leaves that he explains came from his backyard. Then, the second course consists of vegetables smoked in sheep shit, before the chef unveils a tartare made from a reindeer he killed and carried home on his own.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not saying this stoic Icelander gets off on making American celebrities eat his sheep feces and yard waste, while dragging reindeer corpses across the fjords. I’m just saying he seems like someone who is being tracked down by the <em>Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.</em></p>
<p>And that’s episode one. You often hear the phrase “They should have sent a poet” used to indicate that a character on screen has been confronted with such profound, staggering beauty that they lack the capacity to truly communicate what they have experienced. In this case, maybe it’s best to let all the poets stay home where it’s safe, while Zac and Darin play the Circle Game next to some of the world’s greatest natural wonders.</p>
<h3>Episode 2: France</h3>
<p>The second episode gets off to an awkward start as the show’s crew manages to piss off the president of the Lourdes Office of Medical Observations. Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis is interrupted when someone needs to check Zac’s mic, so the good doctor replies by saying he doesn’t care if either one of them are famous as he walks away.</p>

<p>This is a really compelling way to start an episode of a documentary series. I remember one time I was interviewing Ken Burns as he prepared for a live presentation. As we were speaking before the show, he was repeatedly drowned out by the house speakers, which were blaring <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/pitbull" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pitbull</a>. I think it’s smart for a show like this to acknowledge that things don’t always go so smoothly.</p>
<p>Looking forward, this episode focuses on water and humanity’s need for it. Suitably, the episode titled “France” begins in Los Angeles. Here <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac</a> is joined by <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/anna-kendrick" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anna Kendrick</a> as they visit a water sommelier.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16772 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-anna-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><em>You may know <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/anna-kendrick" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anna Kendrick</a> from <em>Pitch Perfect</em> or her ongoing role in the <em>Trolls </em>cinematic universe. Here she plays the over enthusiastic water novice. I’m sure she’s simply trying to play up her excitement for the camera here, but really no one should ever be this animated about the concept of osmosis.</em></p>
<p>In a scene that is at the least tonedeaf and at the most completely offensive, our water sommelier insults the “highly chlorinated” tap water in West Hollywood, as if Americans in major cities aren’t being poisoned by their own drinking water. Surely, the people who made this episode know better. As <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/movie/alfred-hitchcock-more-than-just-a-profile" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hitchcock</a> would say, this possible oversight serves as the bomb under the table for the episode. As the audience, we’re on edge because <em>we know it’s there.</em> Now to see if those on screen can figure things out before it all blows up in their face.</p>
<p>The taste test begins with a “thick” Australian, which is compared to olive oil. After a hydrotour of Spain and the Mediterranean, we arrive at a water that is available to no one else in America and celebrated for its high metal content. This scene is now bordering on satire. I expect the next course to include Irish babies with a side of Soylent Green.</p>

<p>Moving on, <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/zac-efron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zac</a> and Darin leave <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/anna-kendrick" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anna</a> to venture through the Chunnel (which is this episode’s comedic stand-in for “bore holes”) and they finally reach France. Upon arriving in a new country, Darin coaxes Zac into breaking the first rule we learned from <em>Die Hard</em>: Don’t remove your shoes upon reaching a new location.</p>
<p>Arriving in Paris, Zac explains that the city’s drinking water supply is operated by a public body. They meet with the elected official who oversees Paris’s water, and it’s great that the show is recognizing the city’s commitment to providing clean drinking water to all of its residents.</p>
<p>Also, Paris has public drinking fountains that flow with sparkling water that you can locate with an app. Now, I’m not trying to compare any countries to <em>Mad Max</em>’s parched wastelands choked with war rigs, but there’s a spectrum and it’s important to know where you sit.</p>
<p>Finally, we return to Lourdes and the case of the pissed off medical expert that began this episode. Again, this is a really compelling way to frame things. And it allows Darin to explain how he met Zac as a way to endear themselves to the good doctor.</p>
<p>The story goes that Zac heard Darin on a podcast a few years back.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>That seems to be it. <em>Fascinating.</em></p>
<p>And from there this very subpar friendship with creepy uncle energy really bloomed into the chemistry-free, on-screen marriage you see today.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16774 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zac-dr-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Either way, Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis is ready to explain how he determines a “miraculous healing” as defined by the Catholic Church. This portion of the episode could really use more time because the doctor’s duties seem compelling. Defining himself as a man of science, he sees his role as disproving all medical justifications why a patient might shed their illness before it can even begin to be considered a true miracle.</p>
<p>This episode concludes at an actual sanctuary, which I guess highlights the best and worst of this show so far. There’s a (quantum?) disconnect to this show that finds it opening with a gourmet water tasting and closing on a holy fountain where people pray for the cure to their cancer.</p>
<p>But as I said at the beginning of this piece, we’re so madly removed from the world of <em>Down to Earth with Zac Efron </em>that you might as well view it as escapist fantasy. At least take the time to see beyond your own distancing.</p>
<p>Two episodes down and just six to go. I’m already starting to feel a sense of exhaustion set in from all this vicarious travel. It’s likely a matter of time before my writing starts to resemble a lost journal from the Donner Party and rescue teams discover “I Need a Vacation from this Vacation” carved into my apartment walls. But there remain questions to be answered.</p>
<p>What particular grunts and nods will Darin have for us next time? Will Zac reach peak lumbersexual? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>But don’t worry. I’m going in deep — bore hole deep — so you don’t have to. Pop over for my next segment: episodes 3 and 4, as Zac visits Costa Rica and Sardinia. Until then, in the words of global recognized water sommelier and regional acapella champion <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/anna-kendrick" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anna Kendrick</a>: keep it wet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It took me a little while to warm up to <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/anthony-bourdain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anthony Bourdain</a>, but in all fairness, it took Anthony Bourdain a little while to warm up to Anthony Bourdain.</p>
<div class="title-hero-mobile"><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bourdain-portrait.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16339 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bourdain-portrait.jpg 1280w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bourdain-portrait-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bourdain-portrait-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bourdain-portrait-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bourdain-portrait-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bourdain-portrait-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bourdain-portrait-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bourdain-portrait-150x84.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></div>
<p>Known widely as the bad-boy chef who threw back Oz’s curtain and exposed the masses to the long-protected secrets of the culinary trade, Bourdain was a man who remained uniquely himself as the world changed around him.  And that was part of the great joy of following his many pursuits, from shows to books to podcasts and beyond.  In an entertainment venturi where it’s easy to burn out on chefs, Bourdain was like a fine wine that aged gracefully over time, albeit with decidedly more F-bombs.</p>
<p>He was, in his own words, an “enthusiastic sonofabitch.”  You could see that in everything he did.</p>
<p>For example, I love desserts.  Who doesn’t?  But I got a kick out of the dessert section of one of his books.  This is the <em>whole</em> damn section:</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-dessert.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16338 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-dessert.jpg 1280w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-dessert-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-dessert-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-dessert-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-dessert-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-dessert-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-dessert-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-dessert-150x84.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>It basically just says: “yeah desserts are great, but cheese is more important.”  Can’t really argue with him about that.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>“Cheese is magic.  The cheese course, irreplaceable.  All the knowledge accumulated by mankind and all the mysterious forces of the natural world reside in cheese.”</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Bourdain was both informative and open to new ideas.  He had never travelled extensively before the age of 42, and thus his shows capture a rare sense of wonder about what he’d been missing all those years.  It was a dream job.  Traveling, hanging out with people, eating and drinking.  What a gig.  And Bourdain enjoyed every minute of it.  Frankly, it was a joy to watch someone get ahead who felt like &#8216;one of us&#8217; and yet didn’t take his amazing job for granted.  One of Bourdain&#8217;s defining characteristics is that he never forgot where he came from.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/anthony-bourdain-parts-unknown-trivia-facts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This is a fun article about all the things you never knew about Bourdain.</a> Including a charming tidbit about how his first kitchen job was at 17 years old, as a dishwasher at a wedding.  Later that very night he witnessed the chef having sex with the bride by the garbage, and he was hooked on the kitchen industry for life.  That’s like a Raymond Carver short story right there.</p>

<h3>“Later that very night he witnessed the chef having sex with the bride by the garbage.”</h3>

<p>Here are Bourdain’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44415360" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">5 Tips For Eating Out.</a></p>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.mashed.com/125775/the-untold-truth-of-anthony-bourdain-parts-unknown/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a nice, in-depth piece about Bourdain’s career.</a></p>
<p>Here’s a very unfiltered (even more than usual) Bourdain talking about his career on <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/joe-rogan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joe Rogan&#8217;s</a> podcast.</p>

<p>This interview, shot just six months before he died, Bourdain talks with <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/trevor-noah" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trevor Noah</a> on <em>The Daily Show</em>.  There’s a part of this interview where he’s sitting there listening to Noah, and with the thumb on his upstage hand he’s just kind of tracking the underside edge of the desk.  It’s just so human.</p>

<p>Bourdain’s humanity defined him, from appreciating the life force in others, to highlighting, owning and coming to terms with many of his own shortcomings.</p>
<p>In a time where there’s some complexity and uncertainty, it’s good to remember one of the most memorable American cultural influencers of the last two decades.  A man who saw every meal as a story and every culture as both worthy and interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one&#8217;s lifetime.&#8221;<br />-Mark Twain</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Fans of Bourdain can remember his wit and fascination and passion and taste.  It was a thrill to witness the unfailing curiosity he brought with him to the most remote parts of the world, but even more memorable was what he brought back, and shared with all of us.  </p>
<p>This is a moving tribute to Bourdain by his friend and colleague, Anderson Cooper.</p>
