The Plex for Samsung Smart Hub TVs ( 2015 and prior year models ) is actually made by a third party who does work closely with us and I will ask them about it  but is best to report issues in the forum section for that app https://forums.plex.tv/categories/samsung-smart-hub

If you are on a 2016+ Samsung using our app it should work like I described

I am using Plex for Samsung smart TV with the latest update. When I choose &quot;play next,&quot; the song will play next, but it then becomes the only song in my queue. Any songs previously in queue are no longer there. ]]></description>

Not sure which client you are using but if a Playlist is playing when you are in the library again you can selected the options menu for a particular track ( the three dots ) and choose &quot;Play Next&quot; and it will be added the next song in the playlist. then you can just hit skip forward and that song will play now maintaining your playlist.  sorry if misunderstanding]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are several improvements that would be great....playlist support, gapless, cuesheet support, to name a few.  But the number one thing I would need to use Plex regularly for music is the ability to &quot;Queue Next&quot; a song to the playlist already playing.  I usually just play my entire collection on random, but sometimes I want to hear a certain song.  As it stands now, if I play that song, my current playlist stops and just that one song is in queue.  Then I have to load my library up again, and if the urge to hear something specific strikes, do the whole thing again.  Very frustrating.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d love to switch to listening to music on plex, but alas I cannot. Im sure you&#039;re all very busy getting plex music on to Sonos and other platforms but can you please, please schedule in proper playlist support at some point please? And I dont mean creating playlists within plex that came a while ago; I mean the ability for PMS to read M3U files (or similar) and be able to play them on shuffle/random. I cant imagine anyone with playlists with thousands of songs collected over decades will want to start from scratch and re-create them in plex if they have a spare 3 months; they just want their legacy playlists to show up (pretty easy to save your playlists as a file in case your music app of choice ever corrupts itself). And secondaly please allow sort by genre so we can at least pick a style of music from our collections and play it on random. I&#039;d rather this than have plex try to predict my my mood; If I want to listen to my house music on random while I&#039;m cooking, or my jazz music on Sunday mornings, then I&#039;ll need to continue using winamp; sigh.]]></description>

Maybe Barkley could comment about the possibility of gapless playback.  Plex pass is currently on hold for me...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I finally got my premium music library working properly.  I have a fairly large library of about 175K songs, so I struggled to get it scanned.  That said, I see that Plex can sort by play count, but I can&#039;t find where it actually displays play count for a song.  Any help?  Is it there?  Am I just missing it?]]></description>
