										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>First, the backstory. Remember TV?</h3>
<p>In the beginning, there was TV. And TV was good. It worked like this—you walked into a room, you turned it on, something started playing, and you sat down. Were there choices? Sure. Depending on which decade you spent your formative years in, it coulda been four. Didn’t like what was on that particular channel? Well, you could stand up, turn the dial, and maaaaaybe find something better on. Then the remote came along and with it, channel surfing. And that was also good. All of a sudden you had twenty, thirty, even forty different choices. Turns out, there was usually “something good” on.</p>
<div class="responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/440042479" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<h3>Programming via fax machine</h3>
<p>We loved it because it was simple and we hated it because it was simple. You didn’t have to make a lot of decisions. And there was always something next. There was even a job at TV networks called “the programmer.” And the programmers would stay up all night and debate what was the exact order that shows should be shared with you. Each morning every studio executive would get a fax at five in the morning with something called “the overnights.” And they would know whether or not they had done their job DJ’ing your TV selection as their morning coffee brewed.</p>
<h3>And now, for some breaking news, we go live</h3>

<p>Today Plex is bringing it all back (except for the fax machine, still working on that integration) with free Live TV for everyone, in all 220+ countries that Plex serves. With over <strong>80+ channels</strong> (plus even more coming soon) across all your favorite genres. And this is in addition to the 14,000 (and counting) free movies, documentaries, and TV shows you can find on Plex on-demand, so there’s always something on to fit your mood. Whether it’s live news like <strong>Reuters</strong>, or kids shows like <strong>Toon Goggles</strong>, cooking shows on <strong>Tastemade</strong>, or sports on <strong>fubo Sports Network</strong>, or even eSports on <strong>IGN TV</strong>, we’ve got you covered.</p>
<h3>P.S. all you cord-cutters—add Antenna TV + Live TV and you get Ultimate TV</h3>
<p>If you’re a Plex antenna TV user, then you already know the joys of cord-cutting. With an antenna, tuner, and Plex Pass, many of you already use Plex to stream live local TV to all your devices. Now we’ve expanded your live TV offering for the best of all worlds—free on-demand movies, live local TV, and <strong>80+ streams</strong> of free TV—just to make sure you bathe in the golden rays of television at all times. Look for future improvements to provide options to make navigating the grid even easier and more intuitive.</p>
<h3>Broaden your horizons</h3>

<p>Now you can tune into an entire channel where Bob Ross teaches you how to paint landscapes (on—what else—<strong>The Bob Ross Channel</strong>), one carefree stroke after another. Go on a surf safari with <strong>Surf Now TV</strong>, or learn how to up your dating game on <strong>Love Destination.</strong></p>

<p>Finding safe and sane kids programming is often a challenge for busy parents (some of whom have unfortunately had the disconcerting discovery of what Junior has stumbled onto in that epic four-hour YouTube binge). Now we have fun options for the whole gang like <strong>Kidoodle TV</strong>, <strong>Monster Kids</strong>, <strong>KidsFlix</strong> (noticing a theme yet?), <strong>Squad</strong>, <strong>Toon Goggles</strong>, and <strong>Toon Goggles Jr</strong>. Sweet wholesome serenity (with just enough sliming to keep it real).</p>

<p>If my Google Translate was working properly, here’s where I’d write something super witty in Spanish about our new Spanish language feeds, but let’s just all agree, it’s going to be muy caliente with such offerings as <strong>AFV Español</strong> and <strong>Latin X Pop</strong>. Additionally, there is <strong>BAMBU</strong> for top Chinese entertainment, <strong>KMTV</strong> for all things K-pop, and <strong>AsianCrush</strong> and <strong>YUYU TV</strong> for streams that encompass entertainment far and beyond.</p>

<p>The boat show? Yep, if you’re into boats—or you want to sound like <a href="https://youtu.be/a7NarmrZeC4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a guy who just bought a boat</a>—then now there’s <strong>The Boat Show</strong>. Is there a time and place to watch a network exclusively dedicated to boats? We also have <strong>Choppertown</strong> for those who like to <a href="https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/09/19/heres-a-florida-man-driving-a-street-legal-jet-ski-on-the-highway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drive boats on two wheels down a road</a>.

<p>If you are a pet lover, an animal aficionado, or just plain passionate about parrots (aren’t we all??), tune into <strong>The Pet Collective</strong> and get your fill of smol little baby things, or just leave it on for doggos when you…… go to the other side of the couch to work? Or like, if you just like the four-legged frenz—watch all your favorite furry creatures romp and roll until your heart’s content.</p>

<p>Hey, remember when MTV stood for Music Television instead of, um, the worst of human behavior in bite-sized reality-TV flavored chunks? Well, now you can bring back your own favorite TRL (shout out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AbSd9zd_M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carson Daly</a>!) for your favorite genres: watch everything from <strong>80s Party</strong> to <strong>Party Tyme Karaoke</strong> to <strong>Texas-Sized Hits</strong> and <strong>Electro Anthems</strong>. But wait, what’s that you say? Hold the champagne, put a pause on the Grey Poupon—“Will Plex have the <strong>Yacht Rock</strong> channel?” You bet your sweet docksiders we do! (And whichever therapist told you that you could watch a Bob Seger video too many times, well, they’re just plain wrong.)</p>

<p>Whether you’re thirsty for courtroom television, or behind the scenes of Hollywood, or stand-up comedy, romance, queer cinema, Plex has got a streaming channel for you.</p>
<p>So open up Plex on your phone, smart TV, laptop, or tablet and start streaming. Updates are rolling out throughout the day for Apple TV, iOS devices, Roku, Amazon Fire, Android mobile, Android TV, and <a href="https://app.plex.tv">web desktop</a>, with updates for smart TVs and gaming consoles coming shortly. As with all of Plex’s sources, you can customize the order and visibility of Live TV by re-ordering, unpinning, or even hiding it using your personal settings.</p>
<h3>Create your own kid-friendly channel line-up</h3>
<p>Are your kids old enough to grab the remote from your loving hands? Well now you can fine-tune live TV on Plex for them by setting up a managed user and remove any channels from their lineup you don’t want them watching. You get to be the benevolent overlord who controls the channels your kids get to surf. To learn more about managed user accounts, check out this <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/203948776-managed-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how-to article</a>.</p>
<h3>And now a word from our sponsor</h3>
<p>We’re able to make all of these streams free by having limited—bathroom—commercial breaks. As some astute viewers may have noticed, we’re also experimenting with our first on-air promos. If you love to make silly / emotional / style-ish / profound spots yourselves, drop us a line and we’ll see if we can find a way to feature community-made spots in the mix as well.</p>
<h3>Now you get to do it live too</h3>
<p>So open it up, give it a whirl, and let us know what you think below. If you have any questions, be sure to check our handy support <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/free-live-tv-streaming-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview</a> and <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/faq-live-tv-on-plex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a>.

<h3>Together, but… not</h3>
<p>Hey. So, yeah, times are a little weird right now. We continue to hear from folks how Plex is making their lives a little better under the circumstances, and we couldn&#8217;t be more honored to be a part of that. Our friend Joe tweeted us with a great suggestion the other day:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/plex?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@plex</a> If you currently don’t have your code-ninjas working hard on a built-in ability to host watch parties using your system, I can’t understand why.<br />What an amazing gift to your current subscribers and opportunity to spread/promote the Plex love to a lot more eyeballs.</p>
<p>&mdash; Joe (@joepodell) <a href="https://twitter.com/joepodell/status/1261134735360884737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h3>Plot twist: Joe is a friggin’ mind reader</h3>
<p>It was timely. And a bit prescient. Joe, it turns out our code ninjas have been working hard on building exactly that. It&#8217;s less about getting eyeballs and more about letting people reconnect with each other remotely through the media they love, but credit where it&#8217;s due, Joe, for scooping us on the feature. Frankly, community—whether in-person or virtual—is something that we&#8217;ve all grown a new appreciation for over the past months. So yep, we&#8217;re right there with you.</p>

<h3>Make virtual movie dates a reality</h3>
<p>Today we&#8217;re announcing beta support for an experimental new feature we call <strong>Watch Together</strong>. Find a movie or episode you want to watch together, invite your friends on Plex (or even invite them to join Plex), and let us handle keeping playback in sync for everyone. It&#8217;s pretty great. No more &#8220;okay pressing play in 3, 2, 1&#8230;&#8221; or suffering through the third act in desperate need of a bathroom break. Anyone watching with you can play, pause, or seek around during the session. Before you ask, yes, “that guy” can ruin it for everyone. Pro tip: maybe don&#8217;t invite “<a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/movie/the-cable-guy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that guy</a>” to <strong>Watch Together</strong> with you.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/watch-together-screens-final.gif" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16390" /></p>
<h3>All together now</h3>
<p>As of today, <strong>Watch Together</strong> is supported on Apple platforms (iOS and tvOS), Android platforms (mobile and TV), FireTV, NVIDIA SHIELD and Roku – make sure to update to the latest release. Support for web and other platforms to follow soon. <strong>Watch Together</strong> works with both our free on-demand movies and TV shows and content from your personal media library.  So now your whole extended family can re-watch old videos of your kids playing sportsball even though your parents are thousands of miles away. Or binge on one of our free streaming TV shows (<a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/mary-berry-everyday" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mary Berry</a> anyone?) with your friends across town. It’s never been easier.  For this first iteration, choose your favorite non-Plex app to chat—video, audio, or text—to hang out while you watch. Pausing the movie on one device will pause it for everyone so that we all stay in sync and no one misses a beat.</p>
<h3>Safety not guaranteed</h3>
<p>Some notes: First, this is very much an experimental feature. There&#8217;s a metric tonne of improvements and integrations that we would love to add, and there are some sharp edges, but right now we&#8217;re mostly looking for feedback. How&#8217;s it working for you? Do you long for an integrated voice, text, or video chat? (Obviously, you can just fire up a Zoom or WhatsApp or Houseparty for the time being.) More power to invite additional audience members on the fly? The ability to kick/ban? (You invited “<a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/mr-bean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that guy</a>” didn&#8217;t you?) Maybe even a larger watch party where one or two folks “on the stage” do the speaking (like turning on the director’s commentary on your old faded BluRays)? How would you like to customize your personal viewing party? Let us know in the forums or comments below.</p>
<h3>Straight outta Plex Labs</h3>
<p><strong>Watch Together</strong> comes to you hot outta Plex Labs and will be free to everyone while it remains in official beta. No Plex Pass needed for the time being. So jump in, take it for a spin, and reconnect with some long lost friends over some old favorites or new discoveries.</p>
<p>You’ll find <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/watch-together/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">usage instructions</a> as well as answers to <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/frequently-asked-questions-watch-together/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frequently asked questions</a> on our support site. Something broken or irksome? You could always mention us in an angry tweet, but for best results we suggest you direct your feedback to our <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/tags/c/testing/plex-labs/16/watch-together" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">support forum</a>.</p>
<h3>So sync up, tune in, and chill out</h3>
<p>Give it a shot. Let us know what you think. More importantly, stay safe out there. Stay home. And Watch Together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><del datetime="2020-05-19T13:46:43+00:00">Don’t you hate really long intros that say the same thing that you’re already up to speed on but it’s like a nice social convention perhaps hammered into our heads by our English teachers that everything needs an introduction, even a blog dedicated to introductions needs an introduction that lasts approximately thirty seconds to read?</del></p>
<p>Yeah, well you can skip all that now.</p>
<div class="title-hero-mobile"><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid.jpg" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16346 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid.jpg 2560w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid-1800x1013.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid-1440x810.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/famous-tv-show-intros-grid-150x84.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></div>
<h3>Binge-watching nirvana</h3>
<p>Introducing our brand new Plex Pass feature called (duh) Skip Intro. If you’ve ever binge-watched anything, you know the secret to achieving that smooth multi-episode groove is all about reducing the non-essentials. So our engineers sharpened their pencils and, um, slid their slide-rules in order to figure out how to dynamically skip intros for basically any type of show. That is, without having to manually identify on every single episode what is an opening intro and what is just a kick-ass music break at the start of an episode. When you add in cold-opens, different credits for different seasons, and regional variations, it starts to become a rather thorny problem. </p>
<p>Long story short, we updated your Plex Media Server to analyze your shows in the background in order to deliver some next-level pattern recognition. Once it&#8217;s finished processing, you&#8217;ll see that friendly <strong>Skip Intro</strong> button appear in your supported player app. Magic.</p>
<h3>To boldly go where no DVR has gone before</h3>
<p>Think of it as another reason to get that digital antenna and tuner and set up Plex Live TV and DVR. In addition to watching and recording dozens of HD over-the-air broadcast channels for FREE (here in the States that includes networks like CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX, and PBS plus dozens more depending on your local market), now you can skip intros on all of your recorded shows. Only two caveats: the intro sequence must be at least 20 seconds long (keep reading to see why) and you’ll need a Plex Pass for your playback device. As of today, you’ll see it working on the latest releases of our iOS, Android, Roku, Fire TV, and Web clients – once you’ve updated your Plex Media Server and let it process your TV content.</p>
<h3>Show me the histograms</h3>
<p>A little peek under the hood: The secret ingredient is creating an audio &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; out of the histogram of each episode in a given season of each TV show. It turns out that the vast majority of show intros share common audio signatures for all their episodes (at least for a specific season). After applying some heuristics and a little bit of Special Sauce<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, we&#8217;re able to predict (in almost all cases) precisely when the intro starts and ends. Voila! Get precious minutes of your life back, one episode at a time.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re thrilled to announce that our new big-screen interface is now available for Roku users in the Roku channel store, and it’s also now available as a <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/apple-tv-beta-with-uno-ui/393124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta for Apple TV</a>!</p>
<p>The new UI represents months of hard work, extensive user testing, and ongoing conversation with our community. It’ll continue to be a focus of our efforts as we work to bring the new conventions to our other big-screen and mobile apps, but we’re super happy with the reception to date. Want to know more about how we got here? Read on, and we’ll give you the backstory…</p>

<p>The UI in our apps has been through a few major changes in its time. These have been driven by the shifting needs of the Plex ecosystem, which has become increasingly vast and feature-rich over the years.</p>
<p>These transitions can be a little painful for some, and (believe us!) we do our very best to balance the needs of everyone from the most intense Plex-head running seven servers in their closet (we know you’re out there!) to your grandma or roommate who just wants to check out the odd episode of Friends from time to time (I’m told it didn’t age well). Sometimes we’ve managed to nail these transitions perfectly, and sometimes, unfortunately, we haven’t.</p>
<p>If you’re old enough to remember Plex’s <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/release-007-let-there-be-mini-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">embryonic form OSXBMC</a>, you’ll remember those were simpler times. You plugged a hard drive into your Mac Mini, your Mini into your only TV, stuck your media on that sucker, and played away. There was no server. Our phones still had keypads. These were dark days.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11620 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-osxbmc-ui-screen-1024x578.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-osxbmc-ui-screen-1024x578.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-osxbmc-ui-screen-300x169.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-osxbmc-ui-screen-768x434.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-osxbmc-ui-screen-1800x1017.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-osxbmc-ui-screen-1440x813.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-osxbmc-ui-screen-800x452.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-osxbmc-ui-screen-640x361.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-osxbmc-ui-screen-400x226.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-osxbmc-ui-screen-150x85.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As it became clear that the Future was going to be multi-screened, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/the-road-to-plexnine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we created the Plex Media Server</a>, and turned OSXBMC into a lightweight app which could access it. There’s no question this was a Good Move, but hey, it added some complexity. We stuck with it, our lovely community of dedicated Plexians stuck with it, and I think you’ll agree we’re all better off.</p>
<p>When we introduced our <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/introducing-myplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">service in the cloud</a> (anyone remember “myPlex”?), it unlocked some pretty awesome capabilities. Now you could easily stream from anywhere, and it meant you could share your stuff with family and friends. Pretty spiffy, but our apps were built under the assumption that you had one local server available to you. Shared stuff was all sort of shoehorned off into a corner of the app, and if you wanted to browse it, you got a big flat list. Not so great. So we undertook a redesign effort that we internally thought of as “server-first”—now you could pick the server you wanted to browse, and when you did, you got a first class experience. Again, this introduced a little bit of complexity for some folks who really did have a single, local server. So it wasn’t without its tradeoffs, but again, in the end we think it was worth it.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and we wanted to start dipping our toes in some new streams of content (see what I did there?) that we could bring to all of you wonderful folks in a first class way, as well as people who didn’t have their own server at all. We also realized that it was more likely that you’d have more server-based sources available. Both of these realities posed a challenge to our “server-first” navigation. Streaming content, of course, wasn’t coming from a traditional media server, and navigating between servers was fairly painful. In fact, why should you need to think about servers at all when you should be able to just find the thing you want and play it? (It’s an important factor, of course, but it shouldn’t get in the way.)</p>
<p>As a way of taming the growing number of sources, some of which lived in the cloud, we devised a UI navigation scheme that we referred to internally as “type-first”. That is, you pick the type of media you’re looking for (“I’d like to watch a movie”), then pick from a (smaller) number of sources that contain that type of media. In the end, it was well-intentioned and it solved a few things nicely for many folks, but it also introduced a great deal of friction for some. Based on all the feedback (both internal and external), we went back to the drawing board in search of a better approach.</p>
<p>Internally, we refer to the new effort as “UNO”, since bringing a unified, consistent experience to all platforms and devices is one of the core objectives. A few others include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Restoring some basic usability qualities that suffered a bit under “type-first”. Fewer clicks to get where you want to go. More discoverable actions and sources. More intuitive gestures and navigation. Fewer distractions with things you shouldn’t have to care about.</li>
<li>Ownership and customization. You have complete control over your navigation—you tell Plex what you care about, we build an experience for you, and if you don’t like it, you can rearrange sources, hide sources, and more.</li>
<li>Improved functionality in a multi-source world. Features like Search need to work perfectly to deliver exactly the results you want.</li>
<li>At the core of the experience is the sidebar. In addition to being a better use of screen space than the top menu, it lets you see all the stuff you care about, and none of the stuff you don’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Oh, we didn’t mention that? Well, now that you’re up to speed, we hired them back at a fraction of their normal cost. They also agreed to be referred to as henchmen, instead of elves, so long as we gave them a shout-out on this blog. <em>Seasonal work is a bitch, but now you get all of these updates:</em></p>

<p>Add another notch on the feature list making Xbox One an excellent choice to play your media using Plex. With live TV, switch between watching <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em> to getting your metaphorical ass handed to you on <em>PLAYERUNKNOWN&#8217;S BATTLEGROUNDS</em>. The elves were even thoughtful enough to add full time shifting so pause/play, rewind, and fast forward while you quest to refill your <span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mountain+dew" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>life force</em></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/roku-live-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live TV is nothing new for Roku</a>, but we’ve upgraded the experience to include a whole slew of features including full time shifting. What else can you expect when you watch Live TV on Roku? Take a look at the player controls and you’ll notice a current time/place marker now appears above the progress bar. There’s also an instant replay option for the times you can’t believe what you just saw. Finally, closed captioning is now available (for both DVR and Live TV) for our friends with hearing impairments. Enjoy your media however you’d like (even if it’s because you don’t want to hear the laugh track!).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year it seems like we’ve had extraordinarily weird news. With many upset that Boaty McBoatface was overturned, Trainy McTrainface has risen like a Phoenix born from the ashes of its predecessor. What else? There were enough Flat Earth truthers to unite for a conference, and DMX just released his long-awaited remix of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. I could go on, but it makes me wonder what I’m being distracted from. What’s the REAL scoop? Between being both entertained and horrified by news this year, it’s as important as ever to stay informed and we’re glad you agree.</p>
<p>Since rolling out Plex News in September, we’ve seen a steady growth in the number of users enjoying it. We appreciate the support you’ve shown us in bringing content to Plex and we’ve been listening to your feedback on how to make it even better.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-6871 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-800x511.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-800x511.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-300x192.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-768x491.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-1024x654.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-1800x1150.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-1440x920.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-640x409.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-400x255.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-150x96.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />

<p>So what’s new?</p>
<ul>
<li>For starters, we’ve broadened our support. Plex News is available on Android TV, NVIDIA SHIELD, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Roku, Android Mobile, iOS, and on our web app. Now you can enjoy news bites from culinary adventures to natural disasters, and more. As always, we’ll continue to bring support to other platforms.</li>
<li>We’ve pulled a few levers and re-adjusted our highly scientific news content calibrations to feature more content in each news category, less video duplicates of a popular story, and an overall more balanced experience.</li>
<li>Plex News is in good company: we’ve been able to introduce more content with the Associated Press (AP), Reuters, and Local Now. AP boasts coverage from breaking news to investigative reporting in over 100 countries. Similarly, Reuters is the world’s largest international multimedia news provider. Local Now provides <em>hyperlocal</em> weather, traffic, news, and sports reports.</li>
<li>We’ve made News <em>faster</em> (half seconds add up!) and improved overall performance with miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Want more control over what you see? Want to keep your Plex setup unsullied from the dystopian news of 2017? With a new Plex account setting that lets Plex Home admins enable news for their Managed Users or for other accounts to disable News visibility altogether across their apps, you now have more control over what you see.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these updates are now available as soon as you use Plex News. For more information and frequently asked questions, visit <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/sections/115000541373-News" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Support</a>.</p>

There’s so much amazing media available today that you’d be forgiven for taking in an entire season of Game of Thrones or the whole Marvel cinematic universe (once you figure out the order) without coming up for air. But it turns out some pretty crazy stuff is happening every day in the<em> real</em> universe, too, and we think it’s more important than ever to provide balanced news coverage from a variety of trusted and reliable sources. If Plex were a nutritious media breakfast, it’s kind of like eating your Wheaties. But with less carbs. Those things will kill you.</p>
<p>Starting with our recent <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/we-have-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition of Watchup</a>, we’ve worked hard to partner with the most reputable and trustworthy news sources around the world to bring you coverage from a wide variety of viewpoints. We have over 190 global publisher partners (and growing!), including international sources, like CNN, CBS, Financial Times, and Euronews, and local news sources for over 80% of markets in the US. We also have regional content for many other countries and we’re continually adding new sources. So whether you’re a #woke hipster or an <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old man yelling at a cloud</a>, we’ve got something for you.<br />

Plex News is especially exciting to us because it follows a progression we started with Live TV and DVR where we’re bringing you great media from outside your library in a way which integrates seamlessly and beautifully. This makes it easier than ever to start using Plex if you’re new, and gives you another universe of content to explore outside of your own media, without ever leaving Plex.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re wondering how frighteningly busy (warning: we still have lots of terrible Halloween puns on the brain) we’ve been this past month, you needn’t look further than our <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/categories/release-announcements" target="_blank">Release Announcements forum</a>, where you can see we’ve made updates to a dozen products in October. Let’s walk through some of the highlights!</p>
<ul>
<li>We released <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1281387/#Comment_1281387" target="_blank">Plex for Android 5.0</a>, which includes brand new sync technology (much faster and more reliable syncing, you can finally sync playlists, and a sparkly new sync interface). The Android app now includes a slimmed down version of the actual Plex Media Server, just like iOS. Version 5.0 also include the <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/seek-plex-shall-find-leveling-web-app/">lighting fast enhanced search</a> which first debuted in the web app.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-5735 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-800x396.jpg" alt="android-mobile-halloween-2" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-800x396.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-1024x506.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-768x380.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-1536x759.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-1440x712.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-640x316.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-400x198.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-150x74.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2.jpg 1800w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve made four updates to the Plex Media Server, including launching the highly anticipated new <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/mcstreamy-brain-take-world-two-easy-steps/">Streaming Brain</a> feature, and made a number of improvements to stability and performance.</li>
<li>We released a few updates to the web app, including some <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1283373/#Comment_1283373" target="_blank">major enhancements</a> to the Plex DVR interface. That’s right, in case you missed it, you can now use Plex as the world’s best DVR.</li>
<li>The Plex for Windows app has seen five updates, including the same awesome <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1282932/#Comment_1282932" target="_blank">enhanced search functionality</a> we just rolled out to Android. We might be proud parents, but we think it’s the best Universal app in the entire Microsoft store.</li>
</ul>

<li>We made a <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1291003/#Comment_1291003" target="_blank">sweet update</a> to our Roku app with support for the newest hardware models, as well as improved quality settings and support for Streaming Brain.</li>
<li>Just in time for Halloween, our Apple TV app now <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1282953/#Comment_1282953" target="_blank">supports <del datetime="2016-11-01T16:23:33+00:00">spooky</del> dark mode</a>.

<ul>
<li>We released a <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1269507/#Comment_1269507" target="_blank">new iOS version</a> with support for uploading videos from the camera roll. Remember, you can now store videos alongside your photos in your Photo libraries!</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, it’s been a great October, with tons of updates and improvements across our ecosystem!</p>
<p>We’re also super excited to announce the release of the world’s first Plex-compatible router. It should be pretty clear by now that our plans for world domination won’t be complete until we run on every device in your house (I’m looking at you, electric pencil sharpener!) Well, as of today we’re officially one step closer to that goal: our very first spooky router!</p>
<p>If you haven’t read up on <a href="https://www.plex.tv/netgear-nighthawk-x10-wireless/" target="_blank">NETGEAR’s Nighthawk X10</a>, it’s a pretty impressive piece of kit. It has several light-up antennae to give it the fastest WiFi in the biz as well as a sinister look, a truly future-proof 10GBe LAN connection, and as of today, the ability to run Plex Media Server on its own! It can even transcode most video on-the-fly so it can hold its own as your one and only Plex device. It may not be able to sharpen a No. 2 Ticonderoga (although come to think of it, we’ve never tried…) but now that it can run Plex it has a clear lead in the world domination department.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.netgear.com/landings/plex/?cid=plex&amp;utm_source=plex&amp;utm_medium=various&amp;utm_campaign=plex" target="_blank">X10</a> is available now in the US and worldwide in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, we subjected Barkley to the special sort of Halloween embarrassment reserved for pets and very small children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Plexians! We just thought we’d take a quick break from all the hard work and let you know what we’ve been up to for the last few weeks. We’ll highlight the most awesome new features, releases, and news from across our ecosystem.</p>
<p>First stop, the Roku. They’re small, cute, and dependable. Much like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Tribbles">tribble</a>, but much less trouble.</p>
<ul>
<li>We added Rotten Tomato movie ratings. (Is it bad that I almost accidentally <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/quayle3.htm">pulled a Dan Quayle</a>?)</li>
<li>One of our most popular features, TV theme music, is back in the new app.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/27134/plex-for-roku#latest)">giant list</a> of fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next stop, iOS. I’ll refrain from making a comment about hipster facial hair, even though I use an iOS device and currently have hipster facial hair.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve added a lovely “post-play” screen which encourages you to keep watching until way past your bedtime.
<div class="clearfix" style="padding-top: 20px"><img class="alignleft size-blog wp-image-2847" style="max-width: 375px" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/post-play.jpg" alt="post-play" /></div>
</li>
<li>We’ve added Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews.
<div class="clearfix" style="padding-top: 20px"><img class="alignleft size-blog wp-image-2844" style="max-width: 375px" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ios-reviews.jpg" alt="ios-reviews" /></div>
</li>
<li>You can now stream ALAC music files to your devices. Please only listen via headphones connected to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bravo-Audio-V1-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B00A2QKTLW/">tube headphone amp</a> for your device.</li>
<li>You can now change your remote audio quality setting, so when you’ve left your tube amp at home and have a crappy 3G signal, you can still enjoy your music.</li>
<li>A brand new first run experience. If you’re new to Plex, we do a much better job of getting you up to speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next stop, Android and Android TV. I just installed an <a href="https://shield.nvidia.com">Nvidia Shield</a> as my primary living room player, and I have to say, I love it. We’ve added the ability to render embedded PGS/VobSub subtitles inside MKVs. This means no transcoding, no burning, just sweet fast Direct Play (this is on top of the number of other subtitle formats we render in the app).</p>
<p>Also great news, we have <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1191090/#Comment_1191090">a massive update</a> for the Xbox One app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plex Home support!</li>
<li>Music lyrics!</li>
<li>Ability to create and edit playlists.</li>
<li>Much more media direct played (HEVC/FLAC/ALAC/WAV).</li>
<li>Stepping through videos will use chapter timestamps if they exist.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-2850" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/192.168.1.92_Image_1.png" alt="192.168.1.92_Image_1" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-2851" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/192.168.1.92_Image_2.png" alt="192.168.1.92_Image_2" /></p>
<p>Our Smart TV app (PS3, PS4, and many other TVs) also got a large update:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can stream from a mobile server (e.g. iOS). How cool is that?</li>
<li>You can stream from Cloud Sync servers.</li>
<li>You can (finally!) play video and photo playlists.</li>
<li>Last, but not least, a clock!
<div class="clearfix" style="padding-top: 20px"><img class="alignleft size-blog wp-image-2848" style="max-width: 375px" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/clock.jpg" alt="clock" /></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we have some special news for Samsung lovers: our official new smart TV app (as seen on LG, VIZIO and others) will be shipping on all 2016 Samsung smart TVs that support the Tizen operating system! Rollouts will begin with their higher end models, but Plex will be included on all 2016 models that support Tizen apps.</p>

<p>With that quick update, we bid you a fond adieu, and we’ll be back with you shortly!</p>
