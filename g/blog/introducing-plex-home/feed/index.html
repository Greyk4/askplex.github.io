					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely this:

Iâ€™m on board with all the great stuff BUT I feel Restrictions really does need an exclusion criteria. Tagging every movie and TV show gets a little tiresome. Having a choice to exclude â€˜unratedâ€™ content would solve the issue for those that have a concern over XXX.

Thanks guys for all the amazing features and improvements.

P.S. jump controls (+30s, -15s) or something on the web UI would be awesome too :)

Long Live Lifetime Plex Passers !!]]></description>

@Intel Inside ~ the apps are available for anyone in your Plex Home. So your brother can sign in as himself, since he&#039;s a full user. Only managed users need someone to sign in for them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Still unclear on app access. If I&#039;m a Plex Pass subscriber, and I add regular users (not managed) to my Plex Home, will they have access to the apps (without having to pay, as a Plex Pass subscriber does)? Or, do they still have to purchase the apps?

I know there&#039;s a mention about Plex Pass benefits to Home users here: https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/203815766-What-is-Plex-Home- , but, it states having to sign in as the admin account and then switching to the user?

So:
I have Plex Pass and add my brother as a regular account (not managed) into my Home.
Do I have to login with my account on is phone/computer in order to activate the app? And then switch to his user (meaning my account must always be logged into first)? Or, by being in the home, he&#039;ll have access to the apps directly (without having to purchase them) with his own account?

Or is free app access only applicable to managed users?

Thanks]]></description>
