										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was eating french fries when I stumbled across the show <em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/secret-eaters-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Secret Eaters</a></em> on Plex.  It frames itself with kind of a sweet, caring premise: we can help you figure out the secret behind your weight gain.</p>
<p>It’s just data after all, right?  And what we all truly crave is a complete, wholesale chronicling of our entire ingestion data set, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>That&#8217;s where the fun begins.</h3>

<p>Sweet-talking host Anna Richardson has had her share of weight issues and she strips down to her skivvies in the pilot episode to show us the various trouble areas on her body.  I really appreciated her bravery in being a real human and showing us the particular challenges she faces.  More than that, she articulated how she was mostly okay with her current weight and that felt right as well.  To struggle and then to accept yourself for all that you are and be at peace with your body is a vast accomplishment in and of itself.</p>
<p>Once we meet Anna, we see the subjects.  In episode one it’s a 40-something brother and sister who “eat too little,” according to them, and yet seem to be gaining weight.   In the second episode it’s a family of four who eat all healthy, homemade food from mum without any preservatives and can’t figure out why their eating plans are all going pear shaped, so to speak.</p>
<p>In both cases, your heart bleeds for the subjects.  </p>
<p>Yes they agree to have cameras placed strategically around their respective houses to chronicle everything they eat, but there’s a tiny hiccup in the plan that they don’t know about.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>They’re being followed.</h3>

<p>That’s right.  The diabolical part of the show is that day in and day out, for the five days of the study, they have what the show calls “Top P.I.’s” tailing them to work and to their extracurriculars, snapping telephoto images of their various eating escapades and drinking dalliances and adding all of it to both a terrible yarn wall of &#8220;secret eating&#8221; and a table that recreates every single thing the subject ingested.  </p>

<p>It looks like a viking smorgasbord, stretching into the far horizon, dotted with pints of lager and tube steaks and all the shit you swear you dinna eat.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>And then they show it all to you.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from the fact that their targets are localized in the British working class, and have clearly never had a health education course in their lives, the toughest thing about this show is the insta-shame these people feel when they realize that they haven’t cheated the cameras.</p>
<p>When they’re away from home, and the digital scrutiny, they seem to ramp up their eating and drinking.  They go to the pub and have like 11 stouts and nine amarettos and come home and order late night bratwurst while they’re pissed drunk.  One dude literally fell asleep whilst holding the last few bites of a triple cheeseburger aloft in his hand only to wake up to finish it.  </p>
<p>Away from home, Big Macs and fries are scarfed down and something called &#8220;salad cream&#8221; is liberally used to adorn bowls of romaine. </p>
<p>But it’s the drinks.  Dear god the drinks.  </p>
<p>Soda after terrifying soda for the teen who can’t figure out his weight issues.  Like sixteen huge glasses per day interspersed with bag after bag of crisps.  His mum cooking a healthy dinner for the fam, while alone in the kitchen she&#8217;s smashing hard cider like Paul Bunyan, then following it up with a series of rum and cokes poured into vast, oceanic glasses where the measurement is like half rum half soda.  There must have been eight shots of rum in every one.  Even her husband was like BLIMEY!  </p>
<p>In the end, it was kind of great because everyone spent ten days afterward just tackling the direct issue the show had uncovered and all of them quickly lost some weight.  And for those of us watching in the USA, it’s fun because everything is in stone.</p>
<p>“Harold, you came to us 16 stone 8 and now you’re 14 stone 10!”</p>
<p>I have no idea what constitutes a stone, but it doesn&#8217;t matter.  Everyone lost some stone by the end, which is what they wanted, and so we can all come away satisfied.</p>
<p>But it was a slog to get there.  I get it.  Sometimes when you’re in that binge-drinking state, you’ll basically eat a box of farts after pub if they promise to deep fry them and bring them to you in a styrofoam container over moist french fries.</p>
<p>To a person, they were all basically doubling or tripling the amount of food they thought they were eating.  Each report was like “Madeline reports in her journal that she eats about 1100 calories per day, mostly in prawns.  When we followed her with our team of tenacious garbage divers, we found that she was eating a whopping 7870 calories per day, mostly from candy bars from the snack machine at her office, frozen macchiatos three times a day and the eight donuts she eats at tap dancing class every Wednesday night.”</p>
<p>Now, I like to jest about most of this, but one can certainly make a case that the entire premise of <em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/secret-eaters-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Secret Eaters</a></em>&#8211;sort of policing people who have shame and discomfort around eating is at its core, fat-phobic.  </p>
<p>I’ve spent the last 20 years of my life battling weight issues and I really related to the nearly universal revelation that we all chronically under-report our eating.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m certain I do.  </p>
<p>That said: the only reason reporting your eating should ever matter is because you and you alone decide it does.  The premise of the show is that people are confused about their weight and are looking for more data to address the issue.  That&#8217;s their prerogative.  Just as it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s prerogative to also not choose to report.</p>
<p>We all come in different shapes and sizes.  We didn&#8217;t pick our genetics, they picked us.  So the lasting goal should be to get to a point where you feel great inside your body.  For some people, that will look more active than others.  Some people will focus on health, others will focus on comfort. The only right answer is what you and you alone choose.  </p>
<p>The pitfalls of trying to measure up to some ridiculous Barbie and Ken standard have depressed many a dieter.  Don’t fall into that trap.  Understand that there’s a range for all of us and aspire to get to the healthiest part of your personal spectrum.  Your ideal weight is something that is your decision, not society’s.  </p>
<p>So when you’re watching a show like <em><a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/show/secret-eaters-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Secret Eaters</a></em>, try to focus on the note behind the note:  </p>
<p>We are imperfect creatures.  We lie to ourselves.  But the beauty of both is that in most cases, if we so choose, we still have time to arrest the tide and take control of our health.  We have time to choose agency over how we make peace with our bodies, and how we respect and celebrate body diversity.</p>
<p>But we can also choose <em>not </em>to address it.  People get to choose what they want to do with their bodies. To paraphrase comedian Ragen Chastain: if you run a marathon or watch an SVU marathon, they are <em>morally </em>equivalent. &#8220;Health&#8221; in and of itself, is not a virtue. And the idea that it is harms the disabled in a real way.</p>

<p>… she, of course, already knew the news. <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/naya-rivera" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Naya Rivera</a> was missing and had, apparently, drowned. Since, I’ve read that she likely mustered the strength to get her son to the safety of their rented boat and was, then, unable to save herself. My daughter, no doubt, knew all that before me, too. We’re past the tipping point where <em>I</em> tell <em>her</em> what’s going on in the world. </p>
<p>My daughter also knew why I was texting from my bedroom to hers, across the hall. See, we’ve been watching <em>Glee</em> together. It was <em>her</em>  idea. And, now, it’s <em>our</em> thing. Settling into pandemic living and finding ways to occupy ourselves and fill our time with a little… well… glee… she wanted to revisit the iconic show and I had never watched a single episode. (<em>Give me a break. I’m a Black man who turns 49 next week. I wasn’t exactly Ryan Murphy’s target audience.</em>)</p>

<p>Anyway, my daughter wanted to watch it, and, given that I met her mom/my wife in an a capella singing group &#8212; #TrueStory &#8212; I was willing to receive a TV tutorial. What a perfect chance for the student to become the teacher.</p>
<p>Right from the start, we&#8217;ve been having a blast, “Black reacting” to the high school hijinx. Yes, “Black reacting” is a real thing. <em>“Pause it!”</em> <em>“Rewind that!”</em> Stumbling from the room, cackling at Sue Sylvester’s cartoonishly caustic shenanigans, as I proclaim, <em>“I’m done. DONE!”</em></p>
<div class="responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MoFwzKcBx80" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>But I’m never really done. All of it&#8230; the laughter&#8230; the talking to the screen… the synchronized shaking of our heads as either or both of us sigh, “They are a mess…” All of it is part of the fun that explains why, depending on the outrageousness of the episode, we can take a good hour and a half to watch about 45 minutes of TV.</p>
<p>I’ve learned to be careful, though…</p>
<p>There I’ll be, explaining to my writer-in-training tour guide that Finn, that lovably oafish star QB turned Glee Clubber “is the moral guiding voice of this show,” when my baby girl turns to me and casually explains, “He died of a drug overdose.”</p>

<p>DAMN! Not my Finn! Don’t get me wrong. I’m a father, not a child. I understand that <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/cory-monteith" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cory Monteith</a>, the actor who played Finn, died. But still… Finn OD’d?! </p>
<p>As a former defensive end, halfback, and president of my high school’s Glee Club, I had such high hopes for him as he learned how to balance the athlete and the artist, a lesson crystallized for me when one of our coaches once scolded the team, </p>
<blockquote>
<h3>“Just because you play football doesn’t mean you have to walk around here acting like a bunch of ‘football players.”</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>There I’ll be, shaking my head at Puck, with his soft center and his hard degenerate shell, when my innocent bundle of joy will off-handedly mention, “He committed suicide.”</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>“After he was busted with kiddie porn.”</p>
<p>DAMN!  Not my Puck. Sure, he was the worst… but he was also kinda the best. Remember that time he thought it was a good idea to sing “Fat Bottomed Girls” to the… well… let’s just say… plus sized apple of his, usually wandering, eye? Ha! Dummy.</p>
<p>I had such high hopes for Puck, even as I warn daddy’s little girl, as we watch the <em>Glee</em> dating merry go round go round and round, that “Anybody you can steal can be stolen.” Thanks, <em>Glee</em>. I had forgotten to share that one.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>“Anybody you can steal can be stolen.”</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>There I’ll be, cringing at Rachel’s latest egotistical attempt to hog the spotlight and crush her foes when&#8211;</p>

<p>Ok. I should’ve seen that one coming. It was pretty much on brand for the girl who sent her vocal competition to a crack house. I mean… <em>Really, Rachel? REALLY?!?!?!</em></p>
<p>But… Santana?</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16763 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/santana-glee-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>I know the story is tragic, a light extinguished after just 33 years to shine, but I couldn’t help but think, “I knew Santana would turn out great.” <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/naya-rivera" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Naya Rivera</a> brought her fans, including a 48-year-old Black guy sneaking in some daddy-daughter time, just about the most lovable self-proclaimed “bitch” you ever did meet.</p>
<p>There, just beneath the sass and insults and the absurd attempt to claim street cred by letting everybody know she was from Lima Heights Adjacent &#8212; I, literally, laugh out loud every time she screams it, mid-tirade &#8212; there is so much heart. Of course she died saving her child. Is there any greater love?</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>As a parent, I imagine Santana &#8212; I mean Naya &#8212; I mean… both…? I imagine&#8230; her&#8230; summoning every bit of grit and strength to get her son safely into that boat, her final act an act of ultimate love. I guess what shone through her character was a bit of the character she possessed.</p>
<p>And I relate, knowing that as a parent, you’ll do anything for your child. You’d even join your teenage daughter in watching a TV musical targeted at adolescent girls and be amazed by how much you love her… errr… umm… it… how much you love it. Well&#8230; both really.</p>
<p>But I bet she already knows that.</p>
<p>We’ve got multiple coming-of-age stories going on here… and I think one of them is mine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there is one question that could be the central question for 2020, it is:</p>
<p>What…is…<em>happening</em>???</p>
<p>Well, grab your favorite beverage, pull up a chair in Shirley’s station, and contract two little words, because <em>What’s Happening!!</em> is on Plex!</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16564 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling.jpg 2000w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling-1800x972.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling-1440x778.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling-800x432.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling-640x346.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shirley-smiling-150x81.jpg 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>If that piece of news didn’t get you up out of your seat and ecstatically pop-locking in memory of <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/fred-berry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Berry</a>, I am so excited for you.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16569" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rerun-gif.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Back when I was in film school &#8212; it must have been around 1998(!) &#8212; I saw <a href="https://mediaverse.plex.tv/person/shirley-hemphill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shirley Hemphill</a> do stand-up at The Laugh Factory on the Sunset Strip.</p>
<p>Seeing her up there? I was a kid again.</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe how lucky I was. I was in the same room as Shirley!</p>
<p>The Shirley who’d been in my living room so many times with me&#8230; and my sister… and, sometimes, even my mom. She had made me laugh so many times back in Brooklyn and, now, I was in LA… in the same room.</p>
<p>I didn’t even know she <em>did </em>stand-up, but I hung on every word. After all, I’d have to report back to my family.</p>
<p>That night I probably laughed 20% louder than anyone else in the audience, my comedy gratuity for the funniest waitress I’d ever known. When I watch <em>What’s Happening!!</em> I get that feeling all over again.</p>
<p>But you…you get something even better. You get to see <em>What’s Happening!!</em> for the first time!</p>
<p>See, there are two types of people in the world:</p>
<p>1. People who have watched <em>What’s Happening!!</em><br />
2. People whose lives are incomplete.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about being in that second group. Nobody’s perfect, especially not Roger, Rerun, or Dwayne, three black friends, living in 1970s Watts, and bumbling their way through their teen years.</p>

<p>By the time they’re twenty-somethings, they gift the world the &#8220;rent strike&#8221; episode &#8212; no fantasy, clearly unaffordable, New York City apartment for these “friends” &#8212; and the classic sitcom rallying cry “No Roger… No Rerun… No rent!”</p>

<p>You’re so lucky! You can look forward to the moment when their Asian rent-striking neighbor speaks to the greedy landlord in his native tongue only to translate his words for us all, “No Roger… No Rerun… No rent… TURKEY!”</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> In the 70s, “turkey” was a legit slang insult. What a time to be alive!)</p>

<p>Before <em>What’s Happening!!</em> mercifully returned to our lives, I would have had to settle for telling you that story and sighing, “You had to be there.” But now, you didn’t have to be there.</p>
<p>You can be there now.</p>
<p>You can be there as Rerun gets pulled into a cult that worships a head of lettuce and his boys pull off all the shenanigans to get him out.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>“Ralph represents all that which is good, and pure &#8211; Ralph is a head&#8230; of lettuce.”</h3>

<p>You can be there as the guys get busted trying to tape record (that’s right, I said tape record: Google it) a Doobie Brothers concert. (Unfortunately, you can’t be there when I realized <em>why </em>their name was The Doobie Brothers, but that was quite a moment, too.)</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>“Hello, is this The Doobie Brothers? Which Doobie you be?”</h3>

<p>You can be there as these friends learn that, though they might not have a lot, they have each other. And that’s plenty.</p>
<p><em>What’s Happening!!</em> and the esteemed sequel <em>What&#8217;s Happening Now!!</em> are free to watch on Plex. So pop-lock on over to your streaming device of choice and get to bingeing. Will you be glad you did? In-Doobie-tably.</p>
<p>(Alright. You’re right. That joke was as bad as Rob’s cooking. What do you want from me? We can’t all be as funny as Shirley.)</p>
