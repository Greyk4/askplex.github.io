					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just tried the Xbox360 version (mainly for my kids). But to my astonishment, I cannot View or Sort by Folder as i can on other devices. All my movies for kids are in a kids folder, and they cannot find them so easy, and end up looking though adult movies (not xxx!) as they scroll around. Is there going to be a Folder option in future? 
ps. Cheers for the Free xbox edition, i&#039;ve been waiting for months.. :-)]]></description>

@Amy R: To use Plex, you&#039;ll need to run the free Plex Media Server program on your computer (or compatible NAS device). That&#039;s where you set up your content and then you&#039;d use Plex apps (Xbox 360, iOS, etc.) to connect to the server and play content. Tablo does have a channel/plugin available for Plex, but it&#039;s not something we directly support ourselves.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for having this blog/post.  I&#039;m a newbie to cord cutting and am trying to find an exact article describing what I think I might be able to do.  Here goes....

I have:
New HDTV coming in the mail with 2 HDMI ports and 1 USB port.  Not a smart TV.

I have an xBox 360 Kinect.

I have Internet access with a wifi router.

I bought an OTA HDTV antenna.

I&#039;m considering purchasing a Tablo IF:

with the Plex app on my xbox 360, does that now mean:
1) I can use the Tablo to record shows for my TV and my mobile devices
2) I can use the Plex app on xbox 360 to watch those recorded shows right on my TV now (instead of purchasing a Roku, etc.)

I hope that makes sense.  What I don&#039;t want to do is purchase another device (Roku, etc.), JUST to watch the DVR shows back on my TV.

Am I correct?  If so, where do I find out how I can set this up?  I also have an extra pc that I could hook up to my TV (the same TV I want to watch the recorded shows on).

The rest of the rooms in my house would just use the ipad, iphone, etc., but I want to watch those recorded shows on my main TV in my living room, with least amount of devices possible!

Thanks for your help!]]></description>

@Carlos: Sorry you feel that way, but it&#039;s certainly not some Machiavellian scheme. The Plex for Xbox One app simply isn&#039;t yet ready to leave the preview period.
