										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re wondering how frighteningly busy (warning: we still have lots of terrible Halloween puns on the brain) we’ve been this past month, you needn’t look further than our <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/categories/release-announcements" target="_blank">Release Announcements forum</a>, where you can see we’ve made updates to a dozen products in October. Let’s walk through some of the highlights!</p>
<ul>
<li>We released <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1281387/#Comment_1281387" target="_blank">Plex for Android 5.0</a>, which includes brand new sync technology (much faster and more reliable syncing, you can finally sync playlists, and a sparkly new sync interface). The Android app now includes a slimmed down version of the actual Plex Media Server, just like iOS. Version 5.0 also include the <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/seek-plex-shall-find-leveling-web-app/">lighting fast enhanced search</a> which first debuted in the web app.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-5735 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-800x396.jpg" alt="android-mobile-halloween-2" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-800x396.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-1024x506.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-768x380.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-1536x759.jpg 1536w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-1440x712.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-640x316.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-400x198.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2-150x74.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/android-mobile-halloween-2.jpg 1800w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve made four updates to the Plex Media Server, including launching the highly anticipated new <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/mcstreamy-brain-take-world-two-easy-steps/">Streaming Brain</a> feature, and made a number of improvements to stability and performance.</li>
<li>We released a few updates to the web app, including some <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1283373/#Comment_1283373" target="_blank">major enhancements</a> to the Plex DVR interface. That’s right, in case you missed it, you can now use Plex as the world’s best DVR.</li>
<li>The Plex for Windows app has seen five updates, including the same awesome <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1282932/#Comment_1282932" target="_blank">enhanced search functionality</a> we just rolled out to Android. We might be proud parents, but we think it’s the best Universal app in the entire Microsoft store.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>We made a <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1291003/#Comment_1291003" target="_blank">sweet update</a> to our Roku app with support for the newest hardware models, as well as improved quality settings and support for Streaming Brain.</li>
<li>Just in time for Halloween, our Apple TV app now <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1282953/#Comment_1282953" target="_blank">supports <del datetime="2016-11-01T16:23:33+00:00">spooky</del> dark mode</a>. You can also seek in the audio player. And access photo channels. So there.</li>

<ul>
<li>We released a <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1269507/#Comment_1269507" target="_blank">new iOS version</a> with support for uploading videos from the camera roll. Remember, you can now store videos alongside your photos in your Photo libraries!</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, it’s been a great October, with tons of updates and improvements across our ecosystem!</p>
<p>We’re also super excited to announce the release of the world’s first Plex-compatible router. It should be pretty clear by now that our plans for world domination won’t be complete until we run on every device in your house (I’m looking at you, electric pencil sharpener!) Well, as of today we’re officially one step closer to that goal: our very first spooky router!</p>
<p>If you haven’t read up on <a href="https://www.plex.tv/netgear-nighthawk-x10-wireless/" target="_blank">NETGEAR’s Nighthawk X10</a>, it’s a pretty impressive piece of kit. It has several light-up antennae to give it the fastest WiFi in the biz as well as a sinister look, a truly future-proof 10GBe LAN connection, and as of today, the ability to run Plex Media Server on its own! It can even transcode most video on-the-fly so it can hold its own as your one and only Plex device. It may not be able to sharpen a No. 2 Ticonderoga (although come to think of it, we’ve never tried…) but now that it can run Plex it has a clear lead in the world domination department.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.netgear.com/landings/plex/?cid=plex&amp;utm_source=plex&amp;utm_medium=various&amp;utm_campaign=plex" target="_blank">X10</a> is available now in the US and worldwide in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, we subjected Barkley to the special sort of Halloween embarrassment reserved for pets and very small children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That moment when you realize you’ve got so much great stuff to share that a single post couldn’t possibly contain it all… that’s when you write the third installment of our  first-ever “September to Remember” Blog-a-Palooza Blogfest 2016!!! (Yeah, I just made that up. This could be why I’m not in marketing&#8230;)</p>
<p>Anyway, on to the good stuff!</p>
<p>Have I mentioned that we have the most talented Windows platform dev team in the world? Well, back in July we released a ground-up rewrite of our Windows app. It was a massive undertaking, and in addition to bringing in all the features you’d expect from a modern Plex app, it was also engineered under the hood to take advantage of the Windows Universal platform (read: the same app would eventually run everywhere). A great benefit for devs and users alike. Here’s one of our esteemed Windows devs, Matt, announcing this huge release internally:<br />
<img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/slack-windows-universal-notice.png" alt="Slack notice for launch of Plex for Windows Universal App" class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-5595 lazy" style="max-width: 450px" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/slack-windows-universal-notice.png 954w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/slack-windows-universal-notice-300x118.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/slack-windows-universal-notice-768x301.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/slack-windows-universal-notice-800x314.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/slack-windows-universal-notice-640x251.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/slack-windows-universal-notice-400x157.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/slack-windows-universal-notice-150x59.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /><br />
A man of few words, he likes to keep his release notes on-point.</p>
<p>But we haven’t slowed down. Today’s release is the first to be truly Universal&#8211;it now works on all Windows 10 devices, including phones! And we’ve been hard at work on features, too. Here are just a few of the things we’ve been busy adding in Windows land:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17214/windows-10-what-is" target="_blank">Cortana</a>, Microsoft’s personal digital agent, is now supported—go ahead and tell her to “Shuffle the show Archer on Plex”!</li>
<li>We also added support for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/continuum">Continuum</a>. This is a pretty awesome feature—it allows mobile apps to morph into their full-sized desktop equivalent when the Window Phone is connected to a monitor and keyboard. Which means that Plex will continue to look amazing just by plugging it in!</li>
<li>The updated UI we introduced earlier this year is now also available on Windows 10 Mobile!</li>
</ul>

<p>In other news, we’re still hard at work on our DVR beta that we released <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/air-human-plex-dvr-divine/">earlier this month</a>, which gives our loyal Plex Pass users the ability to record content from HDHomeRun devices directly into their Plex library. Your feedback has been fantastic, and even more awesome: we’ve already released a second beta which addresses some of the most important issues and expands the DVR beta to the NVIDIA SHIELD. Head over to the <a href="http://forums.plex.tv/discussion/232362/dvr-beta-two-dvr-harder" target="_blank">DVR beta 2 forum post</a> for details.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dvr-attract-800x493.jpg" alt="Plex DVR for NVIDIA SHIELD" class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-5591 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dvr-attract-800x493.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dvr-attract-300x185.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dvr-attract-1024x631.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dvr-attract-768x474.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dvr-attract-640x395.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dvr-attract-400x247.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dvr-attract-150x93.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dvr-attract.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Finally, in their spare time between creating animated Slack emoji, our Apple TV team has managed to release some amazing new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brand new nav sidebar that lets you jump Home or between libraries, or even switch users or servers with just a few clicks.</li>
<li>Apple TV also now features seamless background music playback, since we know you don’t like to let the beat&#8230; mmm&#8230; drop.</li>
<li>Auto-play all the things! (Apple TV and iOS now include our best-in-class “post-play” experience which helps with the binge watching as well as discovering other related content).</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have have been quiet for a little while, but rest assured, we’re working hard around the clock to bring you much media awesomeness (Literally! Our engineering team is spread over almost every time zone there is!)</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to let you know that Camera Upload (our popular <a href="https://plex.tv/subscription/about">Plex Pass</a> feature for automatically uploading photos from your device right to your Plex library) is now available for our <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/plex/4854f786-ea4b-4db0-b67a-4645c04225d4">Windows Phone 8</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexapp.android">Android</a> apps.</p>

<p>As if that weren’t enough to celebrate, Plex Sync is now available for our <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/plex/647bfcf7-7f87-4a72-ad86-2e6274f969e3">Plex for Windows 8</a> app. Now you can easily sync media to your Surface or Windows PC.</p>
<p>We’ll be back soon with more good tidings, my dear Plexians!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working harder than the elves at the North Pole (although with a higher blood eggnog content), we’ve pushed updates in the last few days to our <a href="http://www.roku.com/channels/#!details/13535/plex">Roku</a>, <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/plex/647bfcf7-7f87-4a72-ad86-2e6274f969e3">Windows 8</a>, and <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/plex/4854f786-ea4b-4db0-b67a-4645c04225d4">Windows Phone 8</a> applications to add support for Plex Companion. What is Plex Companion, exactly? It’s what we call the magic that allows you to fling media between Plex-enabled devices, like from a Windows 8 Phone to a Roku, or from an iPhone/Android phone to the <a href="https://blog.plex.tv/2013/12/06/plex-on-the-chromecast-its-official/">Chromecast</a> plugged into your TV. It also turns your phone or tablet into the world’s best remote control: pause an episode when the phone rings, skip a track you’ve heard too many times, or just find out more about what you’re watching. The best part is, all of your different devices now work together seamlessly to maximize your media enjoyment.</p>
<p>Plex Companion was already supported on Plex Home Theater, Plex for iOS, and Android, so this rounds out the feature across all our apps. Now that we’ve got the basics in, expect us to keep enhancing and making it even richer.</p>
<p>Speaking of Roku, well shucks, we’re incredibly proud to be in the top 10 most watched channels on that device! Seriously, if you’re looking for a <a href="http://www.roku.com/products/compare">stocking stuffer</a> for a loved one (or even just a liked one), you could do <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Lump-Coal-Set-Bags/dp/B002URS4AY">a lot worse</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-20-at-1.02-PM.png" alt="2013 12 20 at 1 02 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re running Windows 8.1, we’ve added support for some cool new features like Live Tiles. Plex will now show you recently added, On Deck, and queued content in a tile. Pretty!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LiveTile.png" alt="LiveTile" border="0" /></p>
<p>There’s also support for share charm, in-application search, and we’ve updated the app to support fluid layouts. If you’re still on Windows 8 and were waiting for a reason to upgrade, you now have a few good ones.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SharingMovieText.png" alt="SharingMovieText" border="0" /></p>
<p>Leading up to Christmas, we’re going to add a Barkley to every post. Just because we can. And literally, as we were hard at work, this is what he was doing. The nerve!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ho, ho, ho! Christmas is just around the bend and we’re full of presents! As you all know, we’re <a href="https://blog.plex.tv/2012/03/30/plex-for-windows-phone/">big</a> <a href="https://blog.plex.tv/2012/12/04/announcing-plex-for-windows-8/">fans</a> of Microsoft’s modern née Metro platform, and have been for a while. We shipped the <a href="https://blog.plex.tv/2012/03/30/plex-for-windows-phone/">original version</a> of the Windows Phone 7 Plex app nearly two years ago, and we’re back today with a <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/plex/4854f786-ea4b-4db0-b67a-4645c04225d4">brand new app</a> for Windows Phone 8, based on <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/plex/647bfcf7-7f87-4a72-ad86-2e6274f969e3">Plex for Windows 8</a>.</p>
<p>As if all this weren’t joy-inspiring enough, we’re also happy to let you know that the app is available exclusively on Nokia Windows Phone 8 devices for the first 30 days, for FREE! Get it while it&#8217;s hot, and tell your friends. Just like the best egg nog, this deal will be gone before you know it.</p>
<p>We’ve revisited every aspect of the Plex experience on these beautiful devices (seriously, check them out!) and we think you’ll really enjoy it. We also now support HTTP Live Streaming, which means higher quality video and full support for a range of subtitle formats. The app is under heavy development, and there are exciting updates coming (a new release supporting our new second screen remote feature will be live in the store shortly).</p>

<p>And what of Barkley? Well, turns out the pup quite likes Windows Phone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know this time of year can be a hectic one for those of you who celebrate Thanksgiving. Lots of traveling, cooking, and turkey hunting (or tofu, although tofu doesn’t put up much of a fight).</p>
<p>In order to try to make your week a more pleasant one, we’ve reduced the prices on our <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plex/id383457673">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexapp.android&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, and <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/plex/647bfcf7-7f87-4a72-ad86-2e6274f969e3">Windows</a> apps [Windows is in the process of price-adjusting] by 60%, down to just $1.99.</p>
<p>We hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving with friends and family, we are incredibly thankful for our amazing community, and we’ll be back soon with more Plex treats for this holiday season&#8230;</p>
<p>OK, you can have a Barkley too. Or is it a lion in the tall grass, awaiting the wild turkey?</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at Plex, we&#8217;re big fans of Drobo. Many of us have owned them since the first-generation units (I had two, personally), and none of us ever lost a single byte of data in years of use.</p>
<p>We were excited to hear about the new <a href="http://www.drobo.com/products/professionals/drobo-5n/">Drobo 5N</a> devices, because they seemed like a really good fit for the Plex Media Server. The deceptively compact boxes are packing a quad-core processor (of which 3 cores are available for applications), and it&#8217;s got much more RAM than your average ARM-based NAS.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-29-at-12.40.09-PM.png" alt="2013 05 29 at 12 40 09 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p>The usual issue with running on low-powered, energy-efficient devices is the lack of ability to do transcoding. However, the Drobo&#8217;s ARM processors, while not able to perform video transcoding in real-time, CAN transcode multi-channel audio to stereo AAC in real-time (easily!), and can remux (a fancy word for repackaging audio and video without converting it) video much faster than real-time. In fact, in our testing it could sustain multiple simultaneous streams without issues.</p>
<p>What does this mean? It means that you can stuff a Drobo full of MKV files and stream them in real-time to our highly rated <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plex/id383457673?mt=8">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexapp.android&amp;hl=en">Android</a> or <a href="http://www.roku.com/channels/#!details/13535/plex">Roku</a> apps. Or stream them to a PS3 using DLNA, or to the <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/plex/647bfcf7-7f87-4a72-ad86-2e6274f969e3">Windows 8 app</a>. Or of course use the <a href="http://plexapp.com/download/plex-media-center.php">Plex Media Center</a> (which doesn&#8217;t require any transcoding), or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexapp.gtv&amp;hl=en">Plex for Google TV</a> (which plays most formats natively), or the <a href="http://reviews.us.samsung.com/7463/G00002687241/samsung-plex-reviews/reviews.htm">Plex app for Samsung</a> devices, or an LG TV. Lots of possibilities!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-29-at-12.15.13-PM.png" alt="2013 05 29 at 12 15 13 PM" border="0" /></p>
<p>You can see Drobo&#8217;s great page on Plex <a href="http://www.drobo.com/solutions/for-professionals/plex.php">here</a> or read the <a href="http://blog.drobo.com/drobo/streaming-and-sharing-all-of-your-stuff-with-drobo-and-plex/">announcement</a> on their blog. Last, but not least, I should note that Barkley fully approves of the Drobo 5N.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, the inexorable march of progress. We have three more releases to talk about today, with lots of goodies. And if you&#8217;re getting bored of hearing about the media server, Win8 app, and Plex/Web, you&#8217;re in for a treat, because the next blog post is going to be about something new, and very exciting. Promise.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that these updates themselves aren&#8217;t exciting. We&#8217;ve been doing  a lot of work on the next-generation transcoder in the media server lately. Currently in use for PlexSync and the Win8 app, it&#8217;ll soon be available for iOS and Android and Plex/Web as well, as it offers many advantages over the old transcoder. For starters, the new version supports burning PGS and VOBSUB subtitle formats, which has been requested for &#8211; literally &#8211; years. Secondly, it should offer much better performance, stability, compatibility with codecs, should fix issues with A/V sync, and many other things. Last, but not least, it leverages a powerful server-side profile mechanism which will soon be used universally for DLNA, PlexSync, and &#8220;live&#8221; transcoding. We&#8217;re building the most advanced media server on the planet here, and the new transcoder is at the heart of it!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a full list of changes in the latest Plex Media Server, available from <a href="http://www.plexapp.com/getplex/">here</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NEW</strong>: Greatly improved (Sync and Win8) transcoder subtitle burning: support SSA and SMI, fix crashes, fix subtitle sync when resuming video.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: Scanning TV shows near the root directory of a volume didn&#8217;t work reliably.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: Send Accept-Ranges: bytes HTTP header when answering requests for media. Fixes Win8 seeking in media.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: DTS audio inside MP4 container could be incorrectly identified as mp4a during media analysis.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: Transcoding certain media files could be pathologically slow. Thanks to Rodger for helping us diagnose the issue!</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: Transcoding video audio from MP3 to AAC would fail in some rare cases.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: A/V sync issues transcoding Smooth Streaming to Windows 8 Store app.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: Actor thumbnails weren&#8217;t being offered correctly to sync clients.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: Removed unnecessary logging when running transcoder.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: Add more logging when Win8 app loopback exemption can&#8217;t be added.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: When a media asset is uploaded, it becomes the default.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: Sync item status could be prematurely reported as complete.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: Added iPad mini sync profile.</li>
<li><strong>NEW</strong>: (API) Allow converting SMI to SRT (format=srt).</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: (Windows) Large log files when number of library paths exceeded 64.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: (Sync) A few issues with sync status not being reported correctly.</li>
<li><strong>FIX</strong>: (Transcoder) An A/V sync issue affecting Win8 app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leveraging the new transcoder, and all these other fixes, is the <a href="http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php/topic/58753-release-notes-for-1018-and-1019/">latest update</a> of Plex for Windows 8. It&#8217;s taken us a few releases, but at this point media playback support on the app is really super good, and it&#8217;s able to play lots of content with remuxing, which (given our support for throttling on the server side), means awesome quality video with minimal CPU usage. Lots of other new stuff, including more keyboard navigation and a cool media information popup, and many bug-fixes.</p>
<p>Plex/Web also got a <a href="http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php/topic/46075-welcome-and-some-known-issues-and-release-notes/page__view__findpost__p__350494">massive update</a>. A giant, thundering, epic update, featuring a redesigned home screen, greatly simplified navigation, and lots of other goodies. Look at this beautiful new dashboard!</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll be back very soon, but until then, I&#8217;ll leave with with two photos of Barkley, who has been your faithful Plex mascot for the last five years. The first one finds him as a puppy, with giant paws and a feisty disposition.</p>

<p>As you can see, he&#8217;s grown in size quite a bit. (Sweetheart, don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year! We hope you had a festive and safe celebration. I personally spent the minutes before midnight in fear, as our neighborhood apparently considers launching illegal fireworks as the island equivalent of having the greenest lawn or largest snowblower. Explosions which sounded like mortars shook the house, and rockets clearly on par with the best commercial fireworks shot overhead, one nearly setting a palm tree on fire. Add the staccato of long chains of firecrackers and clouds of acrid smoke wafting over the entire neighborhood, and it was probably the closest I&#8217;ve even been to a war zone. And where, might you ask, was Barkley during all this action? Tucked in, completely unfazed by all the antics.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/P43A9890.jpg" alt="P43A9890" border="0" /></p>
<p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand, our triad of releases to greet the new year, as a harbinger of much awesomeness to come.</p>
<p>First up, we have a <a href="http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php/topic/55647-release-notes-for-1010/">major update</a> to the Windows 8 Plex app with a bunch of bug fixes, much improved support for keyboard navigation, audio/subtitle stream selection, universal search, a lovely interface to the channel store, and a new high quality (but experimental) option for video playback which allows re-muxing most H.264 video. It&#8217;s available in the Windows 8 store right now.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Search-2.jpg" alt="Search 2" border="0" /></p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ChannelStore.png" alt="ChannelStore" border="0" /></p>
<p>Next up, Plex/Web is kicking it Gangnam style with an awesome <a href="http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php/topic/46075-welcome-and-some-known-issues-and-release-notes/page__view__findpost__p__333282">new release</a>, including the much requested ability to upload custom posters, with drag and drop, no less (or from a URL), some sexy tag completion in the editor, support for retina-quality posters on retina devices, and lots of bug fixes. You&#8217;ll get the update automatically within the next few hours, or you can force an update, as usual.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tag_input.jpg" alt="Tag input" border="0" /></p>
