										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year it seems like we’ve had extraordinarily weird news. With many upset that Boaty McBoatface was overturned, Trainy McTrainface has risen like a Phoenix born from the ashes of its predecessor. What else? There were enough Flat Earth truthers to unite for a conference, and DMX just released his long-awaited remix of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. I could go on, but it makes me wonder what I’m being distracted from. What’s the REAL scoop? Between being both entertained and horrified by news this year, it’s as important as ever to stay informed and we’re glad you agree.</p>
<p>Since rolling out Plex News in September, we’ve seen a steady growth in the number of users enjoying it. We appreciate the support you’ve shown us in bringing content to Plex and we’ve been listening to your feedback on how to make it even better.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-6871 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-800x511.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-800x511.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-300x192.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-768x491.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-1024x654.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-1800x1150.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-1440x920.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-640x409.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-400x255.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-150x96.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />

<p>So what’s new?</p>
<ul>
<li>For starters, we’ve broadened our support. Plex News is available on Android TV, NVIDIA SHIELD, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Roku, Android Mobile, iOS, and on our web app. Now you can enjoy news bites from culinary adventures to natural disasters, and more. As always, we’ll continue to bring support to other platforms.</li>
<li>We’ve pulled a few levers and re-adjusted our highly scientific news content calibrations to feature more content in each news category, less video duplicates of a popular story, and an overall more balanced experience.</li>
<li>Plex News is in good company: we’ve been able to introduce more content with the Associated Press (AP), Reuters, and Local Now. AP boasts coverage from breaking news to investigative reporting in over 100 countries. Similarly, Reuters is the world’s largest international multimedia news provider. Local Now provides <em>hyperlocal</em> weather, traffic, news, and sports reports.</li>
<li>We’ve made News <em>faster</em> (half seconds add up!) and improved overall performance with miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Want more control over what you see? Want to keep your Plex setup unsullied from the dystopian news of 2017? With a new Plex account setting that lets Plex Home admins enable news for their Managed Users or for other accounts to disable News visibility altogether across their apps, you now have more control over what you see.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these updates are now available as soon as you use Plex News. For more information and frequently asked questions, visit <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/sections/115000541373-News" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Support</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we launched Plex DVR back in September, we’ve been hard at work turning it into the best DVR on the planet — it’s hard work keeping track of all those TV schedules and herding those teams of tuners toward a seamless, Plexy library of beautiful HD shows. We couldn’t be more proud that our little DVR managed to spin off a complete Laserdisc franchise along the way!</p>

<p>Well, almost complete, that is… astute readers may have noticed a missing chapter&#8230;</p>

<p>That’s right, today we’re rolling out support for Live TV! And we’re doing it in a truly Plexy way. It’s built right in to the Media Server, so you’ll be able to stream live (starting with our Android TV and iOS apps, with more to come) anywhere in the world through the power of Plex!</p>

<p>Just think… you can now use Plex to follow along with your favorite sportsball team in real time! Or better yet, tune in to today’s episode of &#8220;The Price is Right&#8221; right this second! No more waiting until the recording is done, which means no more Showcase Showdown spoilers! Come on down! (Can you tell that I’ve done most of my Live TV development and testing work during that awesome daytime timeslot?)</p>
<p>So, Live is pretty huge, but that’s not all we’re announcing today. We’ve also made a bunch of improvements to our DVR:</p>
<p>In-app DVR Management: You can now browse the program guide, manage recordings, and more directly from the Android TV and iOS apps (with more to follow).</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blog-image-natural-sort-800x450.png" alt="Sort by Channel - Plex Live TV &amp; DVR" class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-6397 lazy" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blog-image-natural-sort-800x450.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blog-image-natural-sort-300x169.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blog-image-natural-sort-768x432.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blog-image-natural-sort-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blog-image-natural-sort-1440x810.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blog-image-natural-sort-640x360.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blog-image-natural-sort-400x225.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blog-image-natural-sort-150x84.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blog-image-natural-sort.png 1600w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Expanded Tuner Support: We initially supported HDHomeRun tuners, which are still a great option, but today we’re announcing hugely expanded support for lots of popular tuners including models from Hauppauge, AVerMedia, DVBLogic and more! (We’ve got a <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/225877427" target="_blank">complete list here</a>) Several of these USB tuners even work directly with one of our favorite all-in-one Media Server options: the NVIDIA SHIELD.</p>
<p>General DVR Enhancements: In the process of building Live TV support, we’ve seriously leveled up our core DVR engine. The scheduler is even smarter, and it handles overlapping recordings on the same channel as well as the ability to watch live and record simultaneously.</p>
<p>Remember, Plex Live TV and DVR is a Plex Pass only feature, and is immediately available for Plex Pass users. You can find out more info about Plex Live TV and DVR <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/dvr/" target="_blank">here</a> as well.</p>
<p>To summarize, we&#8217;ve just made Plex an even more awesome choice for the aspiring cord-cutter: You can use a wide variety of tuner (and server) hardware to easily access a giant universe of freely available media in many countries around the world, both recording into your library and streaming live! Oh, and please, help control the pet population. Have your pet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZytpnElPI_E" target="_blank">spayed or neutered</a>. Goodbye, everybody!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That moment when you realize you’ve got so much great stuff to share that a single post couldn’t possibly contain it all… that’s when you write the third installment of our  first-ever “September to Remember” Blog-a-Palooza Blogfest 2016!!! (Yeah, I just made that up. This could be why I’m not in marketing&#8230;)</p>
<p>Anyway, on to the good stuff!</p>
<p>Have I mentioned that we have the most talented Windows platform dev team in the world? Well, back in July we released a ground-up rewrite of our Windows app. It was a massive undertaking, and in addition to bringing in all the features you’d expect from a modern Plex app, it was also engineered under the hood to take advantage of the Windows Universal platform (read: the same app would eventually run everywhere). A great benefit for devs and users alike. Here’s one of our esteemed Windows devs, Matt, announcing this huge release internally:<br />

A man of few words, he likes to keep his release notes on-point.</p>
<p>But we haven’t slowed down. Today’s release is the first to be truly Universal&#8211;it now works on all Windows 10 devices, including phones! And we’ve been hard at work on features, too. Here are just a few of the things we’ve been busy adding in Windows land:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17214/windows-10-what-is" target="_blank">Cortana</a>, Microsoft’s personal digital agent, is now supported—go ahead and tell her to “Shuffle the show Archer on Plex”!</li>
<li>We also added support for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/continuum">Continuum</a>. This is a pretty awesome feature—it allows mobile apps to morph into their full-sized desktop equivalent when the Window Phone is connected to a monitor and keyboard. Which means that Plex will continue to look amazing just by plugging it in!</li>
<li>The updated UI we introduced earlier this year is now also available on Windows 10 Mobile!</li>
</ul>

<p>In other news, we’re still hard at work on our DVR beta that we released <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/air-human-plex-dvr-divine/">earlier this month</a>, which gives our loyal Plex Pass users the ability to record content from HDHomeRun devices directly into their Plex library. Your feedback has been fantastic, and even more awesome: we’ve already released a second beta which addresses some of the most important issues and expands the DVR beta to the NVIDIA SHIELD. Head over to the <a href="http://forums.plex.tv/discussion/232362/dvr-beta-two-dvr-harder" target="_blank">DVR beta 2 forum post</a> for details.</p>

<p>Finally, in their spare time between creating animated Slack emoji, our Apple TV team has managed to release some amazing new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brand new nav sidebar that lets you jump Home or between libraries, or even switch users or servers with just a few clicks.</li>
<li>Apple TV also now features seamless background music playback, since we know you don’t like to let the beat&#8230; mmm&#8230; drop.</li>
<li>Auto-play all the things! (Apple TV and iOS now include our best-in-class “post-play” experience which helps with the binge watching as well as discovering other related content).</li>
</ul>

<p>So whatever platform you love, we wish you a happy &#8220;September to Remember&#8221; Blog-a-Palooza Blogfest 2016 (see, it’s catchy!), and believe me we’ve got even more great stuff in store. Stay tuned, go forth, and Plex On!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re not familiar with the <a href="https://shield.nvidia.com">NVIDIA SHIELD</a>, we think it’s one of the most exciting streaming devices on the market. Combining support for 4K video, features like voice search, and a crazy-powerful <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/tegra-x1-processor.html">NVIDIA Tegra® X1</a> brain, this thing was born to run Plex.</p>
<p>As you might know, we’ve had a lovely Android TV app for <a href="https://blog.plex.tv/2014/06/25/plex-brand-new-android-tv/">quite some time now</a>, and it&#8217;s getting better all the time. But the NVIDIA SHIELD, with its <span class="s1">64-bit CPU and massive GPU, allows us to make it extra special by letting you run the entire Plex Media Server directly on the device!</span></p>
<p>You read that right: the SHIELD is so powerful that it can not only run our Android TV interface better than just about anything out there, it can also run the full media server, <em>including</em> support for hardware-accelerated video transcoding (H.264, MPEG2 and HEVC)! With multiple simultaneous streams! As for storage, you get up to 500GB right on the SHIELD, and you can easily add more via USB or over the network.</p>
<p>The 500GB NVIDIA SHIELD Pro is really the first all-in-one Plex box that combines the power of the Media Server with awesome media playback capabilities. Did we mention it supports 4K video @ 60fps?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re working on some final bits with the awesome team at NVIDIA which will be included in their next firmware update, scheduled for later this month. At that point, <span class="s1">the software that makes the media server run will be updated over the air</span>!</p>
<p>A-FAQ (About to be Frequently Asked Questions):</p>
<p><em>Will you integrate the media server into [insert favorite device]</em>? The NVIDIA SHIELD had all the right components to make the integration successful, most importantly its extremely powerful CPU/GPU. We&#8217;ll continue to evaluate other platforms.</p>
<p><em>When will we get the hardware transcoding for [insert other platform]</em>? Again, the SHIELD offers the perfect mix of capabilities for us to be able to enable this functionality. In the future we&#8217;d like to expand to support accelerated transcoding on other platforms as well.</p>
<p class="p1">(<strong>Update with more FAQs:</strong>)</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Will the 16GB SHIELD version be supported too</em>? Absolutely! While it has less internal storage, you can always connect a USB drive or network storage location (via SMB) with either version.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Can I use content from a network location (NAS, computer, drive connected to router, etc.)</em>? You&#8217;ll be able to connect to network storage locations via SMB on the NVIDIA SHIELD.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>How do I manage Plex Media Server when running on the NVIDIA SHIELD</em>? You&#8217;ll use the Plex Web App to manage the server just like when running on any other device. You enable/disable the server from running through the regular Plex client on the SHIELD but management is through the Plex Web app in a browser.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Can I access the plugins folder to install channels/plugins manually</em>? </span><span class="s1">We&#8217;re investigating the possibility of being able to manually install channels and plugins outside of the Channel Directory, but we don&#8217;t know yet if that will be available at launch.</span></p>
<p class="p1">More info can also be found on NVIDIA&#8217;s <a href="https://shield.nvidia.com/support/nvidia-android-tv/faq/1#plex">FAQ page</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Plexians! We just thought we’d take a quick break from all the hard work and let you know what we’ve been up to for the last few weeks. We’ll highlight the most awesome new features, releases, and news from across our ecosystem.</p>
<p>First stop, the Roku. They’re small, cute, and dependable. Much like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Tribbles">tribble</a>, but much less trouble.</p>
<ul>
<li>We added Rotten Tomato movie ratings. (Is it bad that I almost accidentally <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/quayle3.htm">pulled a Dan Quayle</a>?)</li>
<li>One of our most popular features, TV theme music, is back in the new app.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/27134/plex-for-roku#latest)">giant list</a> of fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next stop, iOS. I’ll refrain from making a comment about hipster facial hair, even though I use an iOS device and currently have hipster facial hair.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve added a lovely “post-play” screen which encourages you to keep watching until way past your bedtime.
<div class="clearfix" style="padding-top: 20px"><img class="alignleft size-blog wp-image-2847" style="max-width: 375px" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/post-play.jpg" alt="post-play" /></div>
</li>
<li>We’ve added Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews.
<div class="clearfix" style="padding-top: 20px"><img class="alignleft size-blog wp-image-2844" style="max-width: 375px" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ios-reviews.jpg" alt="ios-reviews" /></div>
</li>
<li>You can now stream ALAC music files to your devices. Please only listen via headphones connected to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bravo-Audio-V1-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B00A2QKTLW/">tube headphone amp</a> for your device.</li>
<li>You can now change your remote audio quality setting, so when you’ve left your tube amp at home and have a crappy 3G signal, you can still enjoy your music.</li>
<li>A brand new first run experience. If you’re new to Plex, we do a much better job of getting you up to speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next stop, Android and Android TV. I just installed an <a href="https://shield.nvidia.com">Nvidia Shield</a> as my primary living room player, and I have to say, I love it. We’ve added the ability to render embedded PGS/VobSub subtitles inside MKVs. This means no transcoding, no burning, just sweet fast Direct Play (this is on top of the number of other subtitle formats we render in the app).</p>
<p>Also great news, we have <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/1191090/#Comment_1191090">a massive update</a> for the Xbox One app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plex Home support!</li>
<li>Music lyrics!</li>
<li>Ability to create and edit playlists.</li>
<li>Much more media direct played (HEVC/FLAC/ALAC/WAV).</li>
<li>Stepping through videos will use chapter timestamps if they exist.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-2850" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/192.168.1.92_Image_1.png" alt="192.168.1.92_Image_1" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-2851" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/192.168.1.92_Image_2.png" alt="192.168.1.92_Image_2" /></p>
<p>Our Smart TV app (PS3, PS4, and many other TVs) also got a large update:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can stream from a mobile server (e.g. iOS). How cool is that?</li>
<li>You can stream from Cloud Sync servers.</li>
<li>You can (finally!) play video and photo playlists.</li>
<li>Last, but not least, a clock!
<div class="clearfix" style="padding-top: 20px"><img class="alignleft size-blog wp-image-2848" style="max-width: 375px" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/clock.jpg" alt="clock" /></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we have some special news for Samsung lovers: our official new smart TV app (as seen on LG, VIZIO and others) will be shipping on all 2016 Samsung smart TVs that support the Tizen operating system! Rollouts will begin with their higher end models, but Plex will be included on all 2016 models that support Tizen apps.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-blog wp-image-2854" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-31-at-2.44.21-PM.png" alt="Plex for Samsung smart TV" /></p>
<p>With that quick update, we bid you a fond adieu, and we’ll be back with you shortly!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-2838" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2144.jpg" alt="IMG_2144" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been just a few days since Apple finally released their <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2010/tn2267.html">Video Decode Acceleration Framework Reference</a>, but <a href="http://ryan.plexapp.com/">Ryan</a> has been working hard and we have some exciting news to share with you. He has managed to get Plex integrated with the framework, and for the first time, your GPU is used to decode H.264 video. The results are incredibly impressive, with 720p and 1080p video decoding smoothly with much reduced CPU utilization.</p>
<p>If you have a NVidia 9400M (or the new GT320/330M chipsets), and are running Snow Leopard 10.6.3, take it for a spin! As with the last post, download <a href="http://bluemandrill.com/plex/Plex-hardware-decode.zip"><strike>the binary</strike></a> [try the new binary below] and install it into Plex.app/Contents/MacOS. Once we get a sense of how well it&#8217;s working, we&#8217;ll spin an official release.</p>
<p>And yes, Al, <a href="http://github.com/elan/plex/tree/v0.8">this build</a> does include the sleep fixes as well.</p>
<p>NOTE: Just to reiterate, <strong>only NVidia 9400M/GT320M/GT330M chipsets benefit</strong> from this. No support for ATI, nor for cards like the NVidia 8800 GT. This is a limitation of the framework provided by Apple (and many thanks for providing it, guys!) and may be addressed in future updates (but don&#8217;t get your hopes up). Also, <strong>Snow Leopard is required</strong>.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Try this <a href="http://bluemandrill.com/plex/Plex-hw-accel-decode-2.zip">new binary</a>, which should fix the crashes. Thanks to Ryan for the quick fixes.</p>
