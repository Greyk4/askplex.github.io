										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago we <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/remastered-thanks-to-you-our-brand-new-tv-navigation-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spelled out</a> some imminent changes to our TV UI, and intimated that great things were to come across the board. “UNO is the future!” we said (“UNO” being our internal code name for the new UI paradigm across all platforms). None of us quite knew why “UNO” was capitalized since it’s not an acronym. “Blame Jason!” we said, and Jason was asleep at the time, so we went with it.</p>
<h3>So what is all this hullabaloo about UNO anyway?</h3>
<p>In case you missed it, UNO is our latest effort to streamline the process of searching, discovering and enjoying your content in your Plex library—no matter the type, no matter the source, no matter the format. It’s an easy, elegant, and powerful system that’s consistent no matter where and how you Plex. It gives you the ultimate control over how you navigate your collection.</p>
<h3>Benefits include: Niftier navigation</h3>
<p>We restore some basic usability qualities that suffered a bit under our “type-first” implementation.</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/navigating-the-big-screen-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fewer clicks to get where you want to go.</a></li>
<li>More discoverable actions and sources.</li>
<li>More intuitive navigation patterns.</li>
<li>Fewer distractions with things you shouldn’t have to care about.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ownership and customization</h3>
<p>You have <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-the-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complete control</a> over your navigation—you tell Plex what you care about, we build an experience for you, and if you don’t like it, you can rearrange sources, hide sources, add or remove rows from your home screen, and more.</p>

<h3>A powerful new sidebar</h3>
<p>In addition to being a better use of screen space than the top menu, it lets you see all the stuff you care about, none of the stuff you don’t, and it gets out of the way when you don’t need to look at it.</p>
<h3>Rolling out wide across the Plexverse</h3>
<p>Fast forward a few months, and now we’re on the precipice of realizing that very vision: the UNO UI is rolling out across all TV platforms this week, it’s <em>super</em> close on iOS and coming thereafter on Android, but importantly this marks the mainstream release of our most sacred (and challenging!) release of all: our beloved Web app.</p>
<h3>Which brings us to our friendly neighborhood Web app</h3>
<p>The Plex Web app is a bit of a special beast, since it serves as both a super popular platform for consuming media and the singular app to admin and curate your Media Servers. We’re fairly confident this app embodies the best of both worlds: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-plex-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimate customization</a> for the media consumer and improved control and curation for the server owner and administrator. It’s always a fun balancing act between the two—and many thanks to everyone who has given feedback along the way.</p>

<p>So go forth and customize! Embrace the sources you love best! Relegate the others to the “More” menu! (It’s okay, I’m pretty sure they won’t be offended <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f937-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) The reins of your media future rest loosely in your hands… YAH!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! This blog post is dedicated to you, the devoted user. The one who’s been with us since early days, meticulously curating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few terabytes</a> of media goodness. The one who would be happy to see us focus on stability and core functionality, and do a bit of house cleaning along the way.</p>
<p>For years now (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/rob-lowe-literally-ama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">li-ter-ah-ly</a>) you’ve have been asking for a way to get <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/subtitle-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtitles</a> without having to go back to the computer, submit to dubious popup ads, move the subs into place, refresh the media, get distracted by a half-eaten hoagie in the fridge. Sorry, where was I? Oh right, so we’re pleased to announce a feature which makes it so easy to find and enable a subtitle, <em>you don’t even have to leave the couch</em>. We use all sorts of smarts to find you the best matches in all sorts of languages (half of all Plexians are outside the US). <strong>This feature will be rolling out as Plex Pass Preview over the next few days</strong> as we fine tune it on Web Desktop, Xbox One, most LG TVs, Plex Media Player, Android mobile, and Android TV (iOS and Apple TV will follow up shortly).</p>

<em>Android TV</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plex has been around for the better part of a decade, and software has a way of behaving like your garage: You had every intention of keeping it neat and organized, but every nook is somehow filled with Star Wars figurines and Amiibos. So it’s critical to hold the occasional yard sale and get rid of all the accumulated cruft. It’s not an uncommon thing for a software company to do—Apple does it (et tu, OpenGL?), and so does Google (RIP Inbox, Reader).</p>
<p>The Plex ecosystem is quite large, and over the years, we’ve sometimes added things that might have made sense at the time, but didn’t age well. We’ve also been <em>incredibly</em> reluctant to take anything away from people who may be using a given feature. Or kill support for a platform with low usage or other challenges. And while any given case might not be significant, they can add up over a decade to a death by a thousand (paper) cuts. So we set out to do some house-cleaning&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn’t approach the process lightly; we looked over usage numbers and took into account maintenance costs and general customer satisfaction. In some cases, we have plans for a future in which a better replacement shows up. Other things, we’re just stabbing in the chest repeatedly with a wooden stake (and hoping it’s not a zombie). But the philosophy is the same—<em>we want to focus our finite energy on providing awesome functionality that works great and makes the folks who use it happy</em>. Without further ado, here’s the list of things we’re retiring:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Plugins</strong>: This was not a decision taken lightly, as they’ve been around for a long time, and we’ve had good times both writing and using them. But bluntly, hardly anyone uses them (less than 2% of users), the ancient protocol they use is a continued pain for clients to support, and if we were to build the feature again, we’d do it very differently in this day and age. For utility-type functionality, we love standalone apps like <a href="https://tautulli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tautulli</a> and believe this is a better approach. But don’t panic—while the Plugin Directory will soon be gone, you can still manually install plugins for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Watch Later</strong>: There’s a small handful of you who still care about this feature – just enough to form a close-knit support group – and we’re super sorry (really) if this disrupts your daily bookmarking, but the feature is costly for us to maintain, and hard to justify in the long run.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: There is very low usage, and it’s also built atop an antediluvian sync engine, so if you rely on Cloud Sync for your day-to-day, things aren’t pretty. DM us a photo of your Cloud Sync library and today’s newspaper and we’ll buy you a beer? (no, not really).</p>
<p>Lastly, as we’ve previously announced, we’re shuttering our hosted Plex Media Server in the cloud (Plex Cloud) as of November 30. For those of you who relied on the service, please accept our heartfelt apology.</p>
<p>So with all that house-cleaning out of the way, what else have we been doing with our newfound laser focus (and laser-equipped sharks? shh… that’s Phase Two)? A lot of good stuff, actually.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Making Sync Great <del datetime="2018-09-25T15:08:31+00:00">Again</del></strong>: We realize that over the years, our vaunted (and premium) offline sync feature hasn’t always worked as reliably as we would have hoped. We decided to form a Seal Team 6 style group tasked with assassinating as many sync bugs as they could, working with client and server groups, as well as with forum users. The team has already made great headway on fixing some of the most annoying bugs, and you’ll begin to see the fruits of their labor across the next wave of updates.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Making Players Play</strong>: We’ve convened a similar squadron of sauron-eyed swashbucklers to kill bugs in the new Android player engine. Yes, it’s awesome that it Direct Plays everything under the sun, but that doesn’t matter if it randomly stops playing Bachelor in Paradise right as Jenna is about to punch Jordan in the face. Also: that show is everything that is wrong about humans.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>The Sound of Music</strong>: Oh, and clamp down hard on your tuks, because we have some amazing music player improvements in the works. I don’t want to give too much away, but if it rhymes with schmapless, it may be coming to a platform near you. :mic-drop:</p>
<p>In conclusion, we’re working hard to improve our focus, spend time on things that matter the most, remove as many distractions as possible, improve stability of the core product, and launch more kick-ass features. Thanks for your feedback!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why hello there, dear reader! We’re back with a massive update to our big-screen app, which runs on many Smart TVs and the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. The update is available on Sony, Vizio, LG, and Toshiba Smart TVs (see the complete <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204080173-Which-Smart-TV-television-models-are-supported-">list of supported models</a>).</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s dive into the new features!</p>
<p><strong>Filtering and Sorting</strong> This highly requested feature lets you slice and dice your media to find exactly what you’re looking for, whether it’s movies by Kurosawa, or albums by Miley. You can also quickly toggle &#8220;unwatched&#8221; if you&#8217;re the kind of person who actually watches media instead of just collecting it. And notice those lovely play/shuffle buttons on the left? Use that to shuffle all your music, or all those 60s movies that you just filtered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-08-26-at-5.57-PM.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-2690" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-08-26-at-5.57-PM.jpg" alt="2015-08-26 at 5.57 PM" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Plex Companion</strong> You can now easily fling media from other Plex apps to the big screen. Keep the music going when you get home, or keep your cat entertained by flinging mouse videos from your phone right to her TV (your cat does have her own TV, right?). You will need an <a href="http://plex.tv/downloads">up to date media server</a> for this feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-08-26-at-7.17-PM.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-2693" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-08-26-at-7.17-PM.jpg" alt="2015-08-26 at 7.17 PM" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Channels</strong> Watch all your favorite online media. Exercise your brain with a TED Talk, or delight in the latest <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks">Vimeo Staff Pick</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-08-26-at-6.09-PM.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-2691" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-08-26-at-6.09-PM.jpg" alt="2015-08-26 at 6.09 PM" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Extras</strong> You can now play movie trailers, along with other movie extras. Also, we&#8217;ve added Cinema Trailers mode, which plays trailers before a movie, for that genuine cinema experience without the sticky floors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-08-26-at-6.13-PM.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-blog wp-image-2692" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-08-26-at-6.13-PM.jpg" alt="2015-08-26 at 6.13 PM" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re following along at home, with a bucket full of <a href="http://thecoconutmama.com/2014/01/coconut-oil-popcorn/">coconut-oil popcorn</a> (delicious! healthy!), you probably saw our <a href="https://blog.plex.tv/2014/10/05/plex-xbox-one-xbox-360/">recent announcement</a> where we unveiled a new direction for Plex in the living room. Beautiful library browsing and new and exciting content discovery features all wrapped up in a pair of brand new apps that feel perfectly at home on the big screen.</p>
<p>But what if you&#8217;re not a gamer, or have no plans to add an Xbox to your personal media arsenal any time soon? Or maybe you’re just a minimalist, and prefer not having any boxes next to your TV. You watch movies on the floor, crosslegged, eschewing non-hemp footwear and personal hygiene. We’re fine with that too.</p>
<p>Not only that, we&#8217;re happy to say that we can lend at least some of you a hand. We&#8217;re thrilled to announce our brand new Plex app for VIZIO Smart TVs, available today for Plex Pass subscribers! Once the Plex Pass preview period ends, the app will be available to purchase for a one-time fee if you don’t have a Plex Pass.</p>
<p>If you’re in the market for a new TV, you’ve probably heard that VIZIO just launched its delicious <a href="http://www.vizio.com/p-series">P-Series</a> lineup of 4K TVs. Starting at just $999 (really!?) these are truly lovely displays with all sorts of fancy features like HEVC hardware decoding and local dimming. Definitely worth a look if you&#8217;re in the market for a new display. If you already have a 2013 (E/M series, except ones where the app store is called &#8220;Vizio Internet Apps” and not &#8220;Vizio Internet Apps Plus&#8221;) or 2014 (E/M/P) series, you&#8217;re also good to go; just navigate to the VIZIO app store and grab the Plex app today. Like the Xbox apps, the VIZIO app is also focused on video at first (we&#8217;re working hard on music and photos, and they&#8217;ll be available in an update as soon as they&#8217;re ready). In case you can&#8217;t find the remote fast enough, feast your eyes on the images below to get a taste of what it looks like.</p>
<p>In order to use this new app, you MUST install the latest release of the media server; available on our <a href="https://plex.tv/downloads">Downloads page</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week has been a big one for TV-related announcements. Apple annouced their revamped Apple TV, and Boxee was quick to reply with their own thoughts on the matter. It turns out that now is the perfect time for us to explain our vision for the future of Plex and television as well.</p>
<p>Today, Plex requires that you have a Mac connected to your TV. As sexy as they are, a Mac Mini is $699. And let&#8217;s face it, you probably have a few televisions, so it becomes an expensive proposition to Plex-ify your house, especially now that you can stream your library all over with Plex/Nine. Of course, on the flip side, a Mac Mini is a powerful computer that can be used for other meaningful tasks like 3D modeling, genome sequencing, or World of Warcraft.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;border: 0px initial initial" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/MacMini.png" alt="MacMini.png" border="0" /></p>
<p>Another approach is something like the Boxee Box. It&#8217;s $199, which is much better, but still prohibitive for many, and it&#8217;s completely specialized. No way you could send your kid off to college with a Boxee Box, although you have to admit, it would probably help his or her social life. Additionally, releasing a custom piece of hardware is not a trivial endeavor, if we even wanted to attempt such a thing. Embedded systems are hard, and the XBMC codebase from which Plex and Boxee are both derived is a large and complex one. And really, at the end of the day, do you want yet another specialized box sitting by your TV?</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;border: 0px initial initial" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Boxee.png" alt="Boxee.png" border="0" /></p>
<p>Even if you get the design right, you have to be able to price it appropriately. With not outrageously different hardware from Boxee, the new Apple TV is half the price. Apple also has a two-fold advantage over Boxee: They are going to be selling their Apple TV in much higher volume (which means lower cost to produce), and &#8211; critically &#8211; they can subsidize the cost of the device because they make money every time you put your arm around your date and click &#8220;Watch&#8221; on a movie. Also, let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s a typical Apple product: it works perfectly as long as you don&#8217;t stray outside their ecosystem. Your files have to be in their limited range of supported formats, and you only get access to the online content they sanction. It&#8217;s not an open platform in any sense of the word, and trust me, I was the first person hoping to be able to run our Plex iOS app on it.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/AppleTV.png" alt="AppleTV.png" border="0" /></p>
<p>The optimal solution, of course, would be a box that was free, infinitely small, and required no cables. Well, we&#8217;re extremely proud to be able to introduce to you, for the first time, the Plex Box, with exactly those characteristics.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;border: 0px initial initial" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/PlexBox.png" alt="PlexBox.png" border="0" /></p>
<p>How is this possible? Well, we actually have one more &#8220;one more thing&#8221; to announce: We&#8217;re working with LG Electronics (the second largest TV manufacturer in the world) to integrate the Plex platform into their 2011 lineup of Netcast<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> connected TVs and Blu-ray devices. So early next year, when you buy an LG Netcast<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> TV or Blu-ray player, you will have Plex functionality built-in. Specifically, it will connect to a cloud version of the Plex platform for online content, and, if you happen to have a Plex Media Server running anywhere in your house (after all, who doesn&#8217;t have a computer in their house?), you can access your local and online content, in a rich interface, with full metadata. I&#8217;ve seen it, and it looks awesome.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been talking a lot about the importance of getting the architecture right for our platform, and this is a perfect example. Thin clients (LG TV, iOS devices), a smart media server, and plug-ins that can run in the cloud. A single integrated interface to access online content, local content, and personal content.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t even begin to tell you how exciting this is to us. LG chose our platform in no small part because it is OPEN, and that is what makes it special. We have developers all over the world creating plug-ins, helping us evolve the platform, and using it creatively. We wouldn&#8217;t be here without them, and it&#8217;s been an absolute pleasure working with them over the years. I also have enormous respect for LG, who have great products, massively talented engineering, and forward-thinking management. I&#8217;ve been to Korea twice in the last year, and their engineers are super-smart, highly knowledgable, and a delight to work with. They &#8220;get&#8221; where TV is going, and I have to make a confession &#8211; the first time I saw their Plex interface, talking to a remote Plex Media Server and flawlessly streaming content, I had to pretend I had something in my eye. This is a team completely committed to revolutionizing the way we enjoy content, and clearly willing to take chances in doing so, as evidenced by working with a small team like ours.</p>
<p>This is also a massive win for content providers. Yesterday, writing a Plex plug-in would make their content available on a Mac, or a television powered by a Mac. Yesterday, they could suddenly make their content available on 100 million iOS devices. And tomorrow (early next year, technically), they will be able to get their content onto millions of LG TVs and Blu-ray devices. This, friends, is an unprecedented time in history. The distance between content provider and consumer has never been this close or frictionless, and it&#8217;s incredible to be a part of.</p>
<p>So what does this mean to you, our dear users? You&#8217;ve been so supportive over the years, and this is great news for you as well. It means, first and foremost, that we&#8217;ll be able to focus more resources on the development. This will be a full-time job for me and others on the team, which is &#8211; honestly &#8211; a dream come true. The Plex Media Server is the heart and lungs of the platform, and we&#8217;ll be making it rock solid and adding some really, really cool new features. We&#8217;ll be bringing it to more platforms, to make it available everywhere. There will be more content providers investing in writing Plex plug-ins, so your online content choices will grow. And next year, if you&#8217;re upgrading your TV, or or buying an LG Blu-ray player, you&#8217;ll have the ability to get Plex, built in, at no additional cost. Fully integrated into killer consumer electronics gear, exactly as it should be.</p>
<p>And *that* is cool.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long journey this past year. Now you finally know all of the cool stuff we&#8217;ve been working on, and it&#8217;s so great to be able to share it with you. We&#8217;ve re-architected our platform for the future, and thankfully, most of that work is behind us. Now we can focus on making Plex more stable, more usable, and overall more AWESOME.</p>
