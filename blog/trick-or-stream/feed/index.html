					<description><![CDATA[I am not sure if this is the right place to make suggestions for your app, but here goes:

I wanted to make a suggestion to your app. I have a truly extensive library and was very interested in the Playlist functionality. I will give an example of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is rather tedious to create these playlists especially when it is as extensive as the aforementioned and the list itself is publicly available (IMDB). So I was wondering whether you could make something like &quot;Preset&quot; Playlists to popular media or possibly even share playlists among users. This would be a collection of all the media in the list (These are usually public playlists mentioned in IMDB etc. They could be searched for and be downloaded, which then appear as a playlist in Plex. The existing media found/matched in the local library could be shown in &quot;full color&quot; and missing media could be shown as grey-scale (missing). The point though is that I can simply download the playlist and it will cross-reference my local media library and order the media based on the playlist. iow. I can simply download the &quot;Marvel Cinematic Universe&quot; Playlist and start watching all movies/series in the correct order, without having to go through the hassle of having to search and order the media in my own playlist, plus I could quickly identify missing media in my library. Furthermore it would be nice to choose the &quot;preferred quality&quot; in the playlist in the case that movies exist in my library with various qualities (i.e. 480p/720p/1080p, then default to 1080p for example).

In theory this should be simple as the lists exist on IMDB and exact references could easily be made by the movie/episode id&#039;s in IMDB or TV Database ? The lists of the playlists available should be searchable via text-search. i.e. search online for a playlist (maybe even in the plex front-end) then download/&quot;import to plex&quot; option. This then creates the playlist in Plex automatically. In the Playlist view suggestions could be made to playlists similar in genre etc.

Last suggestion could be to auto-create playlists based on the content in my library. i.e. if I have a lot of titles in the &quot;Arrowverse&quot; it could automatically download the playlist and make it available in my playlists section.]]></description>
