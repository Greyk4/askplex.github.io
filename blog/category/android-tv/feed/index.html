<p>Yeah, well you can skip all that now.</p>

<h3>Binge-watching nirvana</h3>
<p>Introducing our brand new Plex Pass feature called (duh) Skip Intro. If you’ve ever binge-watched anything, you know the secret to achieving that smooth multi-episode groove is all about reducing the non-essentials. So our engineers sharpened their pencils and, um, slid their slide-rules in order to figure out how to dynamically skip intros for basically any type of show. That is, without having to manually identify on every single episode what is an opening intro and what is just a kick-ass music break at the start of an episode. When you add in cold-opens, different credits for different seasons, and regional variations, it starts to become a rather thorny problem. </p>
<p>Long story short, we updated your Plex Media Server to analyze your shows in the background in order to deliver some next-level pattern recognition. Once it&#8217;s finished processing, you&#8217;ll see that friendly <strong>Skip Intro</strong> button appear in your supported player app. Magic.</p>
<h3>To boldly go where no DVR has gone before</h3>
<p>Think of it as another reason to get that digital antenna and tuner and set up Plex Live TV and DVR. In addition to watching and recording dozens of HD over-the-air broadcast channels for FREE (here in the States that includes networks like CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX, and PBS plus dozens more depending on your local market), now you can skip intros on all of your recorded shows. Only two caveats: the intro sequence must be at least 20 seconds long (keep reading to see why) and you’ll need a Plex Pass for your playback device. As of today, you’ll see it working on the latest releases of our iOS, Android, Roku, Fire TV, and Web clients – once you’ve updated your Plex Media Server and let it process your TV content.</p>
<h3>Show me the histograms</h3>
<p>A little peek under the hood: The secret ingredient is creating an audio &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; out of the histogram of each episode in a given season of each TV show. It turns out that the vast majority of show intros share common audio signatures for all their episodes (at least for a specific season). After applying some heuristics and a little bit of Special Sauce<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, we&#8217;re able to predict (in almost all cases) precisely when the intro starts and ends. Voila! Get precious minutes of your life back, one episode at a time.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago we <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/remastered-thanks-to-you-our-brand-new-tv-navigation-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spelled out</a> some imminent changes to our TV UI, and intimated that great things were to come across the board. “UNO is the future!” we said (“UNO” being our internal code name for the new UI paradigm across all platforms). None of us quite knew why “UNO” was capitalized since it’s not an acronym. “Blame Jason!” we said, and Jason was asleep at the time, so we went with it.</p>
<h3>So what is all this hullabaloo about UNO anyway?</h3>
<p>In case you missed it, UNO is our latest effort to streamline the process of searching, discovering and enjoying your content in your Plex library—no matter the type, no matter the source, no matter the format. It’s an easy, elegant, and powerful system that’s consistent no matter where and how you Plex. It gives you the ultimate control over how you navigate your collection.</p>
<h3>Benefits include: Niftier navigation</h3>
<p>We restore some basic usability qualities that suffered a bit under our “type-first” implementation.</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/navigating-the-big-screen-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fewer clicks to get where you want to go.</a></li>
<li>More discoverable actions and sources.</li>
<li>More intuitive navigation patterns.</li>
<li>Fewer distractions with things you shouldn’t have to care about.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ownership and customization</h3>

<h3>A powerful new sidebar</h3>
<p>In addition to being a better use of screen space than the top menu, it lets you see all the stuff you care about, none of the stuff you don’t, and it gets out of the way when you don’t need to look at it.</p>
<h3>Rolling out wide across the Plexverse</h3>
<p>Fast forward a few months, and now we’re on the precipice of realizing that very vision: the UNO UI is rolling out across all TV platforms this week, it’s <em>super</em> close on iOS and coming thereafter on Android, but importantly this marks the mainstream release of our most sacred (and challenging!) release of all: our beloved Web app.</p>
<h3>Which brings us to our friendly neighborhood Web app</h3>
<p>The Plex Web app is a bit of a special beast, since it serves as both a super popular platform for consuming media and the singular app to admin and curate your Media Servers.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it’s already April, which somehow scored the three biggest holidays of the year. Seriously, March and August have got to be facepalming themselves with frustration, wondering how April got all the coolness. What other month do you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay the piper</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2019/apr/01/april-fools-day-2019-the-best-jokes-and-pranks-in-one-place" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fool the piper</a>, and <a href="https://giphy.com/explore/420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smoke the piper</a> all within a thirty-day blur?</p>
<p>It also means April happens to be the perfect time to talk about how we’ve added a bit more kick to our already-tasty TIDAL x Plex musical brew with some spicy new enhancements. And to demonstrate exactly how smooth and flavorful this cocktail is, watch as we serve it up to an unsuspecting music aficionado whose universe – and quite possibly his very conception of reality – is about to be completely rocked in sixty seconds flat.</p>

<em>by Hugh Newell</em></p>
<h3>In which we introduce Hector, the hero of our story</h3>
<p>Meet my friend Hector. He’s what you call a <a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/who-are-the-musicians-musicians.497702/page-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">musician’s musician</a>. As well as a fan’s fan. And of course he’s <em>also</em> a waiter’s waiter because, well, the first two things.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hector has been using Plex for well on three and a half years. And he likes to tell me (in between the <em>amuse bouche</em> and the <em>antipasto</em> courses at the rather delicious Italian restaurant he’s working at) that he loves Plex and has tweaked all of his album art to make his library a living monument to Shag (the <a href="http://www.shag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artist</a>, not the <a href="https://flashbak.com/shag-carpet-and-the-sleazy-seventies-19216/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">carpet</a>, though at a certain point in the evening it all kinda becomes one and the same in an <a href="http://www.faberhama.com/Ouroboros-Rug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ouroboros</a> sorta way). After he sweeps away our garlic-soaked crumbs, Hector declares that he is a huge fan of Steely Dan (the band, not William S. Burrough’s prop that, er, electrifies the masterful <em>Naked Lunch</em>).</p>
<p>And I say to him (YES WITH MY MOUTH FULL BECAUSE THIS POINT IS <em>THAT</em> IMPORTANT) “Sure, right, you’re a big Steely Dan fan. But does your library have ‘Everyone’s Gone to the Movies (Demo Version)’?</p>
<p>And he stares down at his fancy Italian leather shoes and you can see his face turn the slightest shade of <em>primavera</em> red, and being the kinda guy who doesn’t want to embarrass friends and waiters, I said, “Hey Nineteen, don’t feel Deacon blue.” Two quick song title references helped lighten the mood up a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2017/10/13/steely-dan-walter-becker-peg-aja-670103.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peg</a>. “I can show you how you can complete your collection in like 60 seconds.”</p>
<p>Hector’s all like, “You’re on.” (But he says it with an Italian accent, because you know, this is a really nice Italian restaurant where everyone speaks with an Italian accent). He continues, “I’ve Plexed my van. It’s out back.”</p>
<p>I say “Oh, you mean like <em>now</em>, now?”</p>
<p>“Yup. I’ve got 60 seconds before table 12 gets their <em>spumoni</em>.” And then he drops his voice a whole 12 tone octave, and says in a gravelly Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Western sort of way: “Or is your whole ‘Plex is the greatest ultra-hi-fidelity music augmentation experience the world has ever known’ claim just a bunch of marketing bunk?”</p>
<h3>A mid-meal wager is placed</h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it was on. And that’s how approximately 22 seconds later, I found myself in Hector’s van betwixt my <em>primo</em> and <em>secondo</em>. I told my dining companion to pick out a nice victory red from the wine list whilst I was away. That’s how real this just got.</p>
<h3>Yes, I got into the van</h3>
<p>Now, don’t worry &#8211; this van was one of those strangely nice Sprinter style vans that had been retrofitted into a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vanlife/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#vanlife</a> sort of vibe that you see popping up on the Instagrams of ultra-hip and attractive people who are also seemingly deeply under-employed. Rest assured, Hector had a halfway decent wifi connection, as well as a rather <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stupid-ipad-accessories-2012-5#a-maxi-pad-for-your-ipad-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impressively decorated</a> iPad Air.</p>
<p>So, just to be clear, despite the preceding set up, it was <strong>not</strong> weird. Or at least, not <em>that</em> weird. Now, did Hector have a few pet reptiles in his van? Maybe yes. But putting Hector in jeopardy with <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/64/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Customs</a> for the unlicensed importation of exotic reptiles is not the point of this post. It’s the transformation of Hector’s Plex music library (and by extension his entire way of life) in a scant 60 seconds – <em>that’s</em> the point of this post. So let’s stop obsessing about the little purple chameleons, okay?</p>
<p>Pulling out a suspiciously placed old-timey stop watch from his trouser pocket, Hector nodded to me, and said, “Do your thing, magic man.” Now to be clear, that’s not my <em>actual</em> name, but given that I was on the clock, I didn’t want to waste time clarifying my bona fides. We had a library to augment and a mind to blow, after all.</p>
<h3>Enter an ocean of music</h3>
<p>So, first thing we did after Hector started his big nickel-plated <a href="https://newatlas.com/birthday-200th-stopwatch/43431/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stop watch</a> (that looked exactly like the one from <em>60 MINUTES</em> that you see before Andy Rooney starts to rant about how he can never find a stapler when he’s in the bathroom) was to launch the Plex app on his iPad.</p>
<p>Cool, we’re just 4 seconds in and already halfway there. Then I said, “Okay, show me The Dan.” And he navigated to his Steely Dan collection for me, and if I could just give Hector some props, it was an IMPRESSIVE display of custom album art. He was truly a master curator. Okay, enough with the praise, I got a <em>secondo</em> to start.</p>
<p>His Steely Dan library prior to massive Plex augmentation looked like this:</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11674 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1024x768.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-300x225.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-768x576.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1800x1350.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-1440x1080.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-800x600.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-640x480.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-400x300.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag-150x113.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steel-dan-plus-shag.png 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>And then while he was talking about that one time he <em>almost</em> met Shag at a gallery in Silver Lake, I told Hector to go to <a href="https://www.plex.tv/music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plex.tv/music</a> and click on the <strong>Get 30 Days Free</strong> button to activate his TIDAL x Plex trial. He shot me a classic left eyebrow arch and asked the timeless question: “Bro, you sure?”</p>
<p>And I said to him, “<em>Absolument, mon frère.</em>” Which isn’t Italian because I took French in high school, but he got the gist anyway. “First month is free, so if it doesn’t turn you on, you can always turn it off. No harm, no foul.”</p>
<h3>Hungry for a FLAC attack</h3>
<p>So, on the Plex <a href="https://www.plex.tv/music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, Hector chose the HiFi edition for his free trial, which delivers something like sixty million tracks in FLAC format, plus 250,000 music videos.</p>
<p>I smiled: “Check out your new Dan, man.”</p>
<p>And lo and behold gentle reader, when his Steely Dan page refreshed (remind you, we’re only at 18 seconds into this 60 second challenge), he saw this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11663" src="https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-steely-dan-add-to-library.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hector gave me a look that said, “Oh my ever-loving god, what black magic is this?” I shot him back a look that implied, “Oh, I guess you just completed your collection with a single click.”</p>
<h3>I casually Venn-diagrammed the concept of awesomeness</h3>
<p>And now we’re at 24 seconds, so I decided to do a little showboating. “Scroll past the TIDAL ALBUMS and you’ll see PLEX RECOMMENDATIONS ON TIDAL.” Hector pondered the list. “Wait. That’s not Steely Dan. Who are these guys? ”</p>
<p>By way of response, I held onto his shoulder, stuck my arm in front of both of us, and did that majestic hand-sweeping-thing in front of his face like Howard Hughes introducing the Spruce Goose: “These are all the artists who <em>sound</em> like Steely Dan but&#8230;” and this <em>but</em> was so significant i had to say it twice, “&#8230; but <em>you</em> don’t have in <em>your</em> library. Yet.” I enunciated the final word in my best movie trailer voice. We both shivered. But it could have been his wicked powerful sub-arctic AC he modded his van with.</p>
<p>Seriously, is he transporting organs in this thing?</p>
<h3>Discover musical discovery with our nifty discovering tools</h3>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11664 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1024x973.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1024x973.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-300x285.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-768x730.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1800x1711.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-1440x1369.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-800x761.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-640x608.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-400x380.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation-150x143.png 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-beatles-tidal-albums-recommendation.png 2026w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>And then at 35 seconds into this process of meta-musical transcendence (it was Easter Sunday after all), I said, “Go ahead and click on Discovery Radio button. This is the music that is guaranteed <em>not</em> to be in your library, but similar to the songs that <em>are</em> already in your library. It’s like discovering a parallel universe of music that you already love.”</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11667 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1024x717.jpg" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1024x717.jpg 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1800x1261.jpg 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-1440x1008.jpg 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-800x560.jpg 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-640x448.jpg 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-400x280.jpg 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations-150x105.jpg 150w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plex-music-radio-stations.jpg 2022w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>He whispered to me like we’ve finally laid eyes on a golden Idol hidden in the far reaches of a spider-infested cave, “So I can get my Dan on <em>without</em> listening to Steely Dan?” And I do that classic move where I create a Venn diagram out of a handy set of tropical mango-scented Sharpies. “Think of Discovery Radio as your favorite band’s favorite tracks – that you’ve never heard of.”</p>
<p>“My favorite’s favorites…” muttered Hector. And I chuckled knowingly to myself: Hombre, we haven’t even begun to explore the cosmos of augmentation possibilities.</p>
<h3>Can an augmented music library actually win back your ex-girlfriend? We report, you decide</h3>
<p>I continued to take him down the rabbit hole with me. “Now get ready for some brand new features we’re launching this week on Android mobile &amp; TV, Apple TV, iPhone and iPad, according to <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/add-tidal-content-to-your-plex-music-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the details on our support site</a>.” In a burst of anticipation, Hector raised his eyebrows like two fuzzy caterpillars, which immediately caught the attention of his little chameleon friends. It was cute and weird all at the same time &#8211; such is #vanlife I suppose.</p>
<p>I continued, “Go to an artist that you’ve only added one album from, probably because your ex-girlfriend’s boyfriend says he was kinda into them that one time you ran into the two love-birds at the <a href="https://www.travelchannel.com/interests/shopping/articles/worlds-best-flea-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flea Market</a> and you just wanted to see what kinda stuff this new guy was made of.”</p>
<p>And Hector said with grim determination, “Yeah. That’d be The Mars Volta.”</p>
<p>I thought to myself, man you are <em>never</em> winning your ex-girlfriend back from a guy with strong music taste like that, but I kept this insight to myself because that’s not <em>my</em> journey in life, nor my quest in the back of this van. To reiterate: my singular goal is to expand minds and augment libraries. And so that’s what I did.</p>
<p>“Cool. <em>Now</em> look up that Mars Volta in your new augmented Plex, and <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Get_Schwifty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show me what you got</a>.” And Hector did so and grinned like he’s just made a hole-in-one in the golf course of life. “Instantly add a few of those deep cuts to your library and blast them outside your ex-girlfriend&#8217;s house sometime.” And he looked at me and said “Add them?” And I was all like, “Yep. You can now <em>add</em> albums from TIDAL right to your native Plex library.”</p>
<h3>And now all eyes turn to thee, Artist TV</h3>
<p>And before he could even process that wizardry, I one-upped myself by hitting him with yet another crazy super-power we’re launching this week. “So you know how you got your Artist Radio? Well <em>now</em> you got Artist TV too on Android mobile &amp; TV, Apple TV, iOS devices.”</p>
<p>He was like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4dZCUtq-yI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>what the freak</em></a>? And even though we only had 12 seconds remaining, I said, “Yep, turn it on and crank it up!” And then boom, he had Steely Dan TV, right there in his van. It’s like <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/most-memorable-moments-from-total-request-live/brandon-michaels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Total Request Live</a> from the old days, but instead of being in Times Square with the dangerously low energy Carson Daly, it’s now in the palm of your hand. Or on the wall of your home. Or on the front of your, uh, tablet. Anyway, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/apps-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you get the picture</a>.</p>
<p>You could say Hector’s jaw dropped. Because it did. Which is why you can say that. Because this post, my friends, is 100% fact-based journalism. The features by which Hector’s Steely Dan-loving mind were blown are available to you as well. Just try it out. And might I repeat our mantra? If it doesn’t turn you on, you can always turn it off.</p>

<h3>About that victory glass of red wine…</h3>
<p>So as I slid back into the restaurant booth, our Branzino arrived (bone-in because it’s that kinda joint) and I smiled at my dining companion. If only she knew the magical worlds Hector and I had just spelunked through in the van.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not an April Fool’s story, nor is it a tale powered by 420, nor even is it a special top secret <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-technology-do-you-think-the-US-government-is-currently-hiding-from-the-public-and-what-are-examples-of-previously-classified-technologies-that-were-later-declassified-and-sold-in-civilian-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">government weapons-grade robotic augmentation project</a> that your mighty tax dollars are funding. Nope. It’s just the same awesome Plex you use and love every month of the year. And now especially in April.</p>
<p><em>Cheers, and as always hit us up in the comments below with your thoughts, tip o’ the hats, shakes o’ the fists, and recommendations on the best Tiramisu joints or camper van rehab Instagram feeds.</em></p>

Well, it&#8217;s almost here again. That day when our nation&#8217;s finest technical minds are focused, laser-like, on fake product announcements and promo videos to match. It&#8217;s not as if we haven&#8217;t been guilty in the past. Some may remember <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/happy-april-fools-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Rickroll of 2013</a>. Clearly one of our finest moments.</p>
<p>But 2019 is all about empowering our loyal friends. Our tireless server admins. The ones who toil day after day on behalf of their own loving friends and family. Ask yourselves: isn&#8217;t it time you give the Gift of Rick?</p>
<p>Since we want folks to be able to get things set up and in place before the 1st, we are letting you know about this today. If you have an active Plex Pass subscription, all you need to do is grab the latest <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex Pass Server beta release</a> and check the &#8220;April Fools 2019&#8221; setting under <em>Settings &gt; Extras</em> (if you already installed the beta release and don’t see the setting, try restarting your server) and we&#8217;ll take care of the rest. On April 1st your shared users will get a very special Rickroll before the first movie they play that day; it has an emoji heart and everything!<br />

I know it’s been a while since we’ve blogged, but on a more serious note (and not wanting to give too much away) April is going to be massive for us on several platforms. Stay tuned. There are seriously awesome things to come.</p>
<p>&#8230; and good luck getting that song out of your head! Rick and Roll!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It will come as no surprise to any long-time reader of this humble publication that we here at Plex are pretty sweet on media. While you might think of us as being focused on media inside your home, we’ve always had an interest in media streaming from that fabulous assortment of cloudy pipes we call the Internet. </p>
<p>The first phase of this interest was Plex Plugins. Although fun to write, they never supported much of the rich library functionality we’ve added over the years, and they also required you to run a server. This notion of needing to run a server at home to access media from the Internet just doesn’t make a lot of sense, which is one of the reasons <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/subtitles-and-sunsets-big-improvements-little-housekeeping/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">we’re retiring them</a>.</p>
<p>The second phase came with <a href="https://www.plex.tv/news-podcasts/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plex News</a> and our recent launch of <a href="https://www.plex.tv/news-podcasts/podcasts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plex Podcasts</a>. We developed a powerful and flexible platform for delivering online media using an API nearly identical to the media server, which is awesome for a few reasons—it&#8217;s a small step (not a giant leap) for apps that are used to talking to Media Servers to support Podcasts and more, and we’ve achieved near-feature parity between online content libraries and their homebound kindred spirits. Podcasts and Plex are a great combination: an enormous trove of incredibly awesome content (OK, and some questionable content) mated with our rich media platform on just about any screen (or speaker) you’d care to use.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce the third phase of our master plan for galactic domination: Web Shows (in beta). In a nutshell, we’ve partnered with a number of media producers to bring you high-quality episodic video content inside Plex! We’ve seeded our catalog with lovely, curated shows from only the highest quality creators; no robotic “top ten life hacks” or sparkly slime spam, and we’re looking forward to growing our catalog with your help. We have the best shows from amazing publishers like Condé Nast, Bonnier Corp., Fandor, Future, TWiT, Jukin, and Studio 71, including shows from Saveur, GQ, Field and Stream, PC Gamer, and Engadget and many more to come.</p>
<p>We’ve always worked to bring you a beautiful, distraction-free experience for your media. Gorgeous interfaces for presenting media in the loveliest way, a marked lack of crazy comment threads, and abundant options for personalization. And now you can enjoy all that is Plex with a bunch of great new content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! This blog post is dedicated to you, the devoted user. The one who’s been with us since early days, meticulously curating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few terabytes</a> of media goodness. The one who would be happy to see us focus on stability and core functionality, and do a bit of house cleaning along the way.</p>
<p>For years now (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/rob-lowe-literally-ama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">li-ter-ah-ly</a>) you’ve have been asking for a way to get <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/subtitle-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtitles</a> without having to go back to the computer, submit to dubious popup ads, move the subs into place, refresh the media, get distracted by a half-eaten hoagie in the fridge. Sorry, where was I? Oh right, so we’re pleased to announce a feature which makes it so easy to find and enable a subtitle, <em>you don’t even have to leave the couch</em>. We use all sorts of smarts to find you the best matches in all sorts of languages (half of all Plexians are outside the US). <strong>This feature will be rolling out as Plex Pass Preview over the next few days</strong> as we fine tune it on Web Desktop, Xbox One, most LG TVs, Plex Media Player, Android mobile, and Android TV (iOS and Apple TV will follow up shortly).</p>

<em>Android TV</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plex has been around for the better part of a decade, and software has a way of behaving like your garage: You had every intention of keeping it neat and organized, but every nook is somehow filled with Star Wars figurines and Amiibos. So it’s critical to hold the occasional yard sale and get rid of all the accumulated cruft. It’s not an uncommon thing for a software company to do—Apple does it (et tu, OpenGL?), and so does Google (RIP Inbox, Reader).</p>
<p>The Plex ecosystem is quite large, and over the years, we’ve sometimes added things that might have made sense at the time, but didn’t age well. We’ve also been <em>incredibly</em> reluctant to take anything away from people who may be using a given feature. Or kill support for a platform with low usage or other challenges. And while any given case might not be significant, they can add up over a decade to a death by a thousand (paper) cuts. So we set out to do some house-cleaning&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn’t approach the process lightly; we looked over usage numbers and took into account maintenance costs and general customer satisfaction. In some cases, we have plans for a future in which a better replacement shows up. Other things, we’re just stabbing in the chest repeatedly with a wooden stake (and hoping it’s not a zombie). But the philosophy is the same—<em>we want to focus our finite energy on providing awesome functionality that works great and makes the folks who use it happy</em>. Without further ado, here’s the list of things we’re retiring:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Plugins</strong>: This was not a decision taken lightly, as they’ve been around for a long time, and we’ve had good times both writing and using them. But bluntly, hardly anyone uses them (less than 2% of users), the ancient protocol they use is a continued pain for clients to support, and if we were to build the feature again, we’d do it very differently in this day and age. For utility-type functionality, we love standalone apps like <a href="https://tautulli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tautulli</a> and believe this is a better approach. But don’t panic—while the Plugin Directory will soon be gone, you can still manually install plugins for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Watch Later</strong>: There’s a small handful of you who still care about this feature – just enough to form a close-knit support group – and we’re super sorry (really) if this disrupts your daily bookmarking, but the feature is costly for us to maintain, and hard to justify in the long run.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f480.png" alt="💀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: There is very low usage, and it’s also built atop an antediluvian sync engine, so if you rely on Cloud Sync for your day-to-day, things aren’t pretty. DM us a photo of your Cloud Sync library and today’s newspaper and we’ll buy you a beer? (no, not really).</p>
<p>Lastly, as we’ve previously announced, we’re shuttering our hosted Plex Media Server in the cloud (Plex Cloud) as of November 30. For those of you who relied on the service, please accept our heartfelt apology.</p>
<p>So with all that house-cleaning out of the way, what else have we been doing with our newfound laser focus (and laser-equipped sharks? shh… that’s Phase Two)? A lot of good stuff, actually.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Making Sync Great <del datetime="2018-09-25T15:08:31+00:00">Again</del></strong>: We realize that over the years, our vaunted (and premium) offline sync feature hasn’t always worked as reliably as we would have hoped. We decided to form a Seal Team 6 style group tasked with assassinating as many sync bugs as they could, working with client and server groups, as well as with forum users. The team has already made great headway on fixing some of the most annoying bugs, and you’ll begin to see the fruits of their labor across the next wave of updates.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Making Players Play</strong>: We’ve convened a similar squadron of sauron-eyed swashbucklers to kill bugs in the new Android player engine. Yes, it’s awesome that it Direct Plays everything under the sun, but that doesn’t matter if it randomly stops playing Bachelor in Paradise right as Jenna is about to punch Jordan in the face. Also: that show is everything that is wrong about humans.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>The Sound of Music</strong>: Oh, and clamp down hard on your tuks, because we have some amazing music player improvements in the works. I don’t want to give too much away, but if it rhymes with schmapless, it may be coming to a platform near you. :mic-drop:</p>
<p>In conclusion, we’re working hard to improve our focus, spend time on things that matter the most, remove as many distractions as possible, improve stability of the core product, and launch more kick-ass features. Thanks for your feedback!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the millions of people who’ve recently cut the cord and those who are <i>cord cutter curious</i>&#8230;we’ve been making improvements to Live TV and DVR to make it easier and all around more kick-ass. With the recent improvements we’ve made, it’s now effortless as ever to continue watching shows, sports, and movies on all of your devices, whether from your collection or using Plex Live TV and DVR.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Android TV and mobile enthusiasts, we’ve released the ability to watch a recording while it’s still being recorded, a process typically requiring dual tuners. So if you’re impatiently waiting to watch your recording of the dubbed version</span> of <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/well-do-it-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Die Hard</a> (AKA the <em>best</em> holiday movie of all time) while it records you don’t have to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timecop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create different and divergent timelines</a> to share the experience with friends.

<p>With full functionality of time shifting on Android, you can play, pause, rewind, or fast-forward your DVR-ed programs. <em>That’s right</em>, you can time shift whatever you&#8217;re watching on Live TV even while recording (<em>until the broadcast is back to real time</em>). Even better, you can also switch from a recorded show to Live TV on the same channel <em>seamlessly</em>. Want to watch <em>Pawn Stars</em> (quality reality TV) while it records, and follow up with<em> Impractical Jokers</em> (but don’t want to record that)? Keep watching on! Whenever you need to, pause and get snacks, use the facilities, have a conversation, eat loudly during a quiet part of the show &#8212; your options are limitless. You can always pick up right where you left off. Don’t be bound by your cable guide and instead follow your gut (or bladder) to your heart’s desire.</p>
<p>Potential time shift scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewind to watch the fumble you missed while you were double-dipping from the communal bowl</li>
<li>Enjoy the televised version of <em>Groundhog Day</em> for that much longer</li>
<li>Fast forward through any cringe-worthy parts of <em>The Voice</em>, <em>The Bachelor</em>, and basically any reality show</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Pass</a> subscribers can now enjoy Live TV, DVR, and even better time shifting available on Android TV and mobile (with Amazon devices to follow). Visit the <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/sections/205778607-DVR-Live-TV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live TV and DVR</a> support pages to learn more, including setup, supported tuners, and frequently asked questions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year it seems like we’ve had extraordinarily weird news. With many upset that Boaty McBoatface was overturned, Trainy McTrainface has risen like a Phoenix born from the ashes of its predecessor. What else? There were enough Flat Earth truthers to unite for a conference, and DMX just released his long-awaited remix of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. I could go on, but it makes me wonder what I’m being distracted from. What’s the REAL scoop? Between being both entertained and horrified by news this year, it’s as important as ever to stay informed and we’re glad you agree.</p>
<p>Since rolling out Plex News in September, we’ve seen a steady growth in the number of users enjoying it. We appreciate the support you’ve shown us in bringing content to Plex and we’ve been listening to your feedback on how to make it even better.</p>
<p><img class="lazy"   class="aligncenter size-blog wp-image-6871 lazy" data-src= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-800x511.png" alt="" data-srcset= "https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-800x511.png 800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-300x192.png 300w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-768x491.png 768w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-1024x654.png 1024w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-1800x1150.png 1800w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-1440x920.png 1440w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-640x409.png 640w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-400x255.png 400w, https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/news-plex-web-home-1-150x96.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />

<p>So what’s new?</p>
<ul>
<li>For starters, we’ve broadened our support. Plex News is available on Android TV, NVIDIA SHIELD, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Roku, Android Mobile, iOS, and on our web app. Now you can enjoy news bites from culinary adventures to natural disasters, and more. As always, we’ll continue to bring support to other platforms.</li>
<li>We’ve pulled a few levers and re-adjusted our highly scientific news content calibrations to feature more content in each news category, less video duplicates of a popular story, and an overall more balanced experience.</li>
<li>Plex News is in good company: we’ve been able to introduce more content with the Associated Press (AP), Reuters, and Local Now. AP boasts coverage from breaking news to investigative reporting in over 100 countries. Similarly, Reuters is the world’s largest international multimedia news provider. Local Now provides <em>hyperlocal</em> weather, traffic, news, and sports reports.</li>
<li>We’ve made News <em>faster</em> (half seconds add up!) and improved overall performance with miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Want more control over what you see? Want to keep your Plex setup unsullied from the dystopian news of 2017? With a new Plex account setting that lets Plex Home admins enable news for their Managed Users or for other accounts to disable News visibility altogether across their apps, you now have more control over what you see.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these updates are now available as soon as you use Plex News. For more information and frequently asked questions, visit <a href="https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/sections/115000541373-News" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Support</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that makes Plex magical is the ability to stream <em>all</em> your media to <em>all</em> your devices, no matter where you are in the world &ndash; it&#8217;s pretty amazing, really, until there&#8217;s a disturbance in <em>The Force</em>: maybe your roommate fired up the microwave for yet another Hot Pocket. (The top of the microwave really isn&#8217;t the best spot for your WiFi router&#8230; but I digress.)</p>
<p>Despite all the impressive tech under the hood, let&#8217;s face it, many of us have experienced the dreaded &#8220;buffering&#8221; from time to time. Well, today we&#8217;re here to tell you about a few new features that will ensure your streams keep streaming even as your Hot Pockets are heating.</p>
<p><strong>Auto Quality (Free)</strong></p>
<p>Plex has always let you pick your video streaming quality: full HD while you&#8217;re home on the couch, or slightly-less-than-HD when you&#8217;re parachuting into a Central American jungle to deprive a republic of its banana. The only problem is, picking a quality manually is a bit like playing darts blindfolded: you&#8217;re just as likely to hit the bullseye as the person next to you. Add in a few simultaneous streams, and it gets even worse: now you’re blindfolded, hangry, and someone just put $20 in the jukebox and hit shuffle on Jimmy Buffett.</p>
<p>Enter our <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/mcstreamy-brain-take-world-two-easy-steps/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Streaming Brain</a> robot, who lives in the server and adjusts quality automatically across all streams in the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">pareto efficiency</a>. Tirelessly and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_(character)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">without complaining</a>, while even taking time out to <a href="https://stores.kotisdesign.com/plex/apparel/plex-mcstreamy/17119" rel="noopener" target="_blank">appear on a t-shirt</a>.</p>
<p>The Auto Quality feature worked so well for our Plex Pass users that we decided to enable the feature for everyone. <strong>It&#8217;s available today on web, Android, iOS, Android TV, and Apple TV</strong>. To start using it, simply turn on the &#8220;Automatically Adjust Quality&#8221; option in the Quality settings of the app.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware-Accelerated Streaming (Plex Pass)</strong></p>
<p>Are you sitting on a reasonably modern CPU or GPU? Are you tired of your Plex server heating half your house in the winter? (Note: This last part is not always bad &ndash; it literally might have saved Leo&#8217;s life in Titanic. Or in The Revenant. Why is he always SO DAMN COLD??)</p>
<p>We&#8217;re Team Kate / Bear here, so it brings us great pleasure to introduce hardware-accelerated streaming. This allows Plex Media Server to take advantage of dedicated hardware support to convert video dramatically more efficiently than ever before. This translates into more streams at higher quality (even HD! 4K!), less processor power, and <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/an-inconvenient-bug-or-two/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">happy-ass polar bears</a>. Everyone wins! (except Leo.)</p>
<p><strong>Hardware-accelerated streaming is available today for <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plex Pass</a> subscribers</strong>. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux with modern Intel processors that support Intel Quick Sync. Some AMD GPUs and NVIDIA GPUs are also supported on Windows and Mac.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate how hard this streaming stuff really is, we recruited Barkley and a garden-variety hose. In this visual metaphor, the water is your episode of The Bachelorette: All that is pure and good in this world. This is the stream upon which Plex feeds. Barkley is the unknown, striking down upon your stream with great vengeance and furious anger. And the grass? Well, the grass represents the plight of the proletariat. Everyone pisses on them. Don&#8217;t be the grass.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tl;dr</a> &ndash; Update your Plex Media Server to experience even smoother streaming using Auto Quality and Hardware-Accelerated Streaming.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re rolling out an awesome addition to your balanced media diet: Plex News. It’s the perfect complement to your media library — video news from some of the most trusted sources on the planet, presented beautifully and seamlessly alongside your own media. And because Plex is all about <em>your</em> media <em>your</em> way, you can personalize your news feed, and our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advanced AI</a> learns what you like and gets smarter the more you watch (since it’s just a robot, it’ll never mock your obsession with the Kardashians or insatiable appetite for stories about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/local/weather/kitten-saved-from-hurricane-harvey-flood-waters/2017/08/28/00efbf54-8c13-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_video.html?utm_term=.12d0c7bfa897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kittens being rescued from floods</a>).<br />

There’s so much amazing media available today that you’d be forgiven for taking in an entire season of Game of Thrones or the whole Marvel cinematic universe (once you figure out the order) without coming up for air. But it turns out some pretty crazy stuff is happening every day in the<em> real</em> universe, too, and we think it’s more important than ever to provide balanced news coverage from a variety of trusted and reliable sources. If Plex were a nutritious media breakfast, it’s kind of like eating your Wheaties. But with less carbs. Those things will kill you.</p>
<p>Starting with our recent <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/we-have-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition of Watchup</a>, we’ve worked hard to partner with the most reputable and trustworthy news sources around the world to bring you coverage from a wide variety of viewpoints. We have over 190 global publisher partners (and growing!), including international sources, like CNN, CBS, Financial Times, and Euronews, and local news sources for over 80% of markets in the US. We also have regional content for many other countries and we’re continually adding new sources. So whether you’re a #woke hipster or an <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old man yelling at a cloud</a>, we’ve got something for you.<br />

Plex News is especially exciting to us because it follows a progression we started with Live TV and DVR where we’re bringing you great media from outside your library in a way which integrates seamlessly and beautifully. This makes it easier than ever to start using Plex if you’re new, and gives you another universe of content to explore outside of your own media, without ever leaving Plex.</p>

As always, other platforms will follow. This feature is ad-supported which means that it comes at no additional cost to you, allowing everyone to enjoy high quality news content.</p>
